            Overflow or Wraparound vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code
            execution in the context of the current user. Exploitation of this issue
            requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.
    CVE-2022-41903:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-41903
        summary: Git is distributed revision control system. `git log` can display
            commits in an arbitrary format using its `--format` specifiers. This functionality
            is also exposed to `git archive` via the `export-subst` gitattribute.
            When processing the padding operators, there is a integer overflow in
            `pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit()` where a `size_t` is stored improperly
            as an `int`, and then added as an offset to a `memcpy()`. This overflow
            can be triggered directly by a user running a command which invokes the
            commit formatting machinery (e.g., `git log --format=...`). It may also
            be triggered indirectly through git archive via the export-subst mechanism,
            which expands format specifiers inside of files within the repository
            during a git archive. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap
            writes, which may result in arbitrary code execution. The problem has
            been patched in the versions published on 2023-01-17, going back to v2.30.7.
            Users are advised to upgrade. Users who are unable to upgrade should disable
            `git archive` in untrusted repositories. If you expose git archive via
            `git daemon`, disable it by running `git config --global daemon.uploadArch
            false`.
    CVE-2022-23521:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-23521
        summary: Git is distributed revision control system. gitattributes are a mechanism
            to allow defining attributes for paths. These attributes can be defined
            by adding a `.gitattributes` file to the repository, which contains a
            set of file patterns and the attributes that should be set for paths matching
            this pattern. When parsing gitattributes, multiple integer overflows can
            occur when there is a huge number of path patterns, a huge number of attributes
            for a single pattern, or when the declared attribute names are huge. These
            overflows can be triggered via a crafted `.gitattributes` file that may
            be part of the commit history. Git silently splits lines longer than 2KB
            when parsing gitattributes from a file, but not when parsing them from
            the index. Consequentially, the failure mode depends on whether the file
            exists in the working tree, the index or both. This integer overflow can
            result in arbitrary heap reads and writes, which may result in remote
            code execution. The problem has been patched in the versions published
            on 2023-01-17, going back to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There
            are no known workarounds for this issue.

        cve_id: CVE-2022-1922
        summary: DOS / potential heap overwrite in mkv demuxing using zlib decompression.
            Integer overflow in matroskademux element in gst_matroska_decompress_data
            function which causes a segfault, or could cause a heap overwrite, depending
            on libc and OS. Depending on the libc used, and the underlying OS capabilities,
            it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite. If the libc uses mmap
            for large chunks, and the OS supports mmap, then it is just a segfault
            (because the realloc before the integer overflow will use mremap to reduce
            the size of the chunk, and it will start to write to unmapped memory).
            However, if using a libc implementation that does not use mmap, or if
            the OS does not support mmap while using libc, then this could result
            in a heap overwrite.

    CVE-2022-24795:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-24795
        summary: yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation
            library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer
            overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing
            with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may
            result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches
            a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation
            of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as
            `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue
            from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this
            issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer.
            Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the
            original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability
            mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation
            for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated
            to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing
            large inputs to YAJL.

    CVE-2021-3782:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-3782
        summary: An internal reference count is held on the buffer pool, incremented
            every time a new buffer is created from the pool. The reference count
            is maintained as an int; on LP64 systems this can cause the reference
            count to overflow if the client creates a large number of wl_shm buffer
            objects, or if it can coerce the server to create a large number of external
            references to the buffer storage. With the reference count overflowing,
            a use-after-free can be constructed on the wl_shm_pool tracking structure,
            where values may be incremented or decremented; it may also be possible
            to construct a limited oracle to leak 4 bytes of server-side memory to
            the attacking client at a time.
    CVE-2022-2566:

        summary: A heap out-of-bounds memory write exists in FFMPEG since version
            5.1. The size calculation in `build_open_gop_key_points()` goes through
            all entries in the loop and adds `sc->ctts_data[i].count` to `sc->sample_offsets_count`.
            This can lead to an integer overflow resulting in a small allocation with
            `av_calloc()`. An attacker can cause remote code execution via a malicious
            mp4 file. We recommend upgrading past commit c953baa084607dd1d84c3bfcce3cf6a87c3e6e05
    CVE-2022-35951:

        summary: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Versions 7.0.0
            and above, prior to 7.0.5 are vulnerable to an Integer Overflow. Executing
            an `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state, with a specially
            crafted `COUNT` argument may cause an integer overflow, a subsequent heap
            overflow, and potentially lead to remote code execution. This has been
            patched in Redis version 7.0.5. No known workarounds exist.

        summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The `RaggedRangOp`
            function takes an argument `limits` that is eventually used to construct
            a `TensorShape` as an `int64`. If `limits` is a very large float, it can
            overflow when converted to an `int64`. This triggers an `InvalidArgument`
            but also throws an abort signal that crashes the program. We have patched
            the issue in GitHub commit 37cefa91bee4eace55715eeef43720b958a01192. The
            fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this

    CVE-2022-29219:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-29219
        summary: Lodestar is a TypeScript implementation of the Ethereum Consensus
            specification. Prior to version 0.36.0, there is a possible consensus
            split given maliciously-crafted `AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing`
            being included on-chain. Because the developers represent `uint64` values
            as native javascript `number`s, there is an issue when those variables
            with large (greater than 2^53) `uint64` values are included on chain.
            In those cases, Lodestar may view valid_`AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing`
            as invalid, due to rounding errors in large `number` values. This causes
            a consensus split, where Lodestar nodes are forked away from the main
            network. Similarly, Lodestar may consider invalid `ProposerSlashing` as
            valid, thus including in proposed blocks that will be considered invalid
            by the network. Version 0.36.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround,
            use `BigInt` to represent `Slot` and `Epoch` values in `AttesterSlashing`
            and `ProposerSlashing` objects. `BigInt` is too slow to be used in all
            `Slot` and `Epoch` cases, so one may carefully use `BigInt` just where
            necessary for consensus.

    CVE-2021-20110:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-20110
        summary: Due to Manage Engine Asset Explorer Agent 1.0.34 not validating HTTPS
            certificates, an attacker on the network can statically configure their
            IP address to match the Asset Explorer's Server IP address. This will
            allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the
            network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken.
            In httphandler.cpp, the agent reaching out over HTTP is vulnerable to
            an Integer Overflow, which can be turned into a Heap Overflow allowing
            for remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM on the agent machine.
            The Integer Overflow occurs when receiving POST response from the Manage
            Engine server, and the agent calling "HttpQueryInfoW" in order to get
            the "Content-Length" size from the incoming POST request. This size is
            taken, but multiplied to a larger amount. If an attacker specifies a Content-Length
            size of 1073741823 or larger, this integer arithmetic will wrap the value
            back around to smaller integer, then calls "calloc" with this size to
            allocate memory. The following API "InternetReadFile" will copy the POST
            data into this buffer, which will be too small for the contents, and cause
            heap overflow.

    CVE-2022-24667:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-24667
        summary: 'A program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial of service
            attack, caused by a network peer sending a specially crafted HPACK-encoded
            header block. This attack affects all swift-nio-http2 versions from 1.0.0
            to 1.19.1. There are a number of implementation errors in the parsing
            of HPACK-encoded header blocks that allow maliciously crafted HPACK header
            blocks to cause crashes in processes using swift-nio-http2. Each of these
            crashes is triggered instead of an integer overflow. A malicious HPACK
            header block could be sent on any of the HPACK-carrying frames in a HTTP/2
            connection (HEADERS and PUSH_PROMISE), at any position. Sending a HPACK
            header block does not require any special permission, so any HTTP/2 connection
            peer may send one. For clients, this means any server to which they connect
            may launch this attack. For servers, anyone they allow to connect to them
            may launch such an attack. The attack is low-effort: it takes very little
            resources to send an appropriately crafted field block. The impact on
            availability is high: receiving a frame carrying this field block immediately
            crashes the server, dropping all in-flight connections and causing the
            service to need to restart. It is straightforward for an attacker to repeatedly
            send appropriately crafted field blocks, so attackers require very few
            resources to achieve a substantial denial of service. The attack does
            not have any confidentiality or integrity risks in and of itself: swift-nio-http2
            is parsing the field block in memory-safe code and the crash is triggered
            instead of an integer overflow. However, sudden process crashes can lead
            to violations of invariants in services, so it is possible that this attack
            can be used to trigger an error condition that has confidentiality or
            integrity risks. The risk can be mitigated if untrusted peers can be prevented
            from communicating with the service. This mitigation is not available
            to many services. The issue is fixed by rewriting the parsing code to
            correctly handle all conditions in the function. The principal issue was
            found by automated fuzzing by oss-fuzz, but several associated bugs in
            the same code were found by code audit and fixed at the same time'

            \ input)` in the file `Snappy.java` receives an array of characters and\

            The function `shuffle(int[] input)` in the file `BitShuffle.java` receives
            an array of integers and applies a bit shuffle on it. It does so by multiplying
            the length by 4 and passing it to the natively compiled shuffle function.
            Since the length is not tested, the multiplication by four can cause an
            integer overflow and become a smaller value than the true size, or even
            zero or negative. In the case of a negative value, a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException`
            exception will raise, which can crash the program. In a case of a value
            that is zero or too small, the code that afterwards references the shuffled
            array will assume a bigger size of the array, which might cause exceptions
            such as `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.


            The same issue exists also when using the `shuffle` functions that receive
            a double, float, long and short, each using a different multiplier that
            may cause the same issue.


            Version 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability.'

    CVE-2022-24724:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-24724
        summary: cmark-gfm is GitHub's extended version of the C reference implementation
            of CommonMark. Prior to versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21, an integer
            overflow in cmark-gfm's table row parsing `table.c:row_from_string` may
            lead to heap memory corruption when parsing tables who's marker rows contain
            more than UINT16_MAX columns. The impact of this heap corruption ranges
            from Information Leak to Arbitrary Code Execution depending on how and
            where `cmark-gfm` is used. If `cmark-gfm` is used for rendering remote
            user controlled markdown, this vulnerability may lead to Remote Code Execution
            (RCE) in applications employing affected versions of the `cmark-gfm` library.
            This vulnerability has been patched in the following cmark-gfm versions
            0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21. A workaround is available. The vulnerability
            exists in the table markdown extensions of cmark-gfm. Disabling the table
            extension will prevent this vulnerability from being triggered.

    CVE-2021-32765:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-32765
        summary: Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database.
            In affected versions Hiredis is vulnurable to integer overflow if provided
            maliciously crafted or corrupted `RESP` `mult-bulk` protocol data. When
            parsing `multi-bulk` (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to check if `count
            * sizeof(redisReply*)` can be represented in `SIZE_MAX`. If it can not,
            and the `calloc()` call doesn't itself make this check, it would result
            in a short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow. Users of hiredis
            who are unable to update may set the [maxelements](https://github.com/redis/hiredis#reader-max-array-elements)
            context option to a value small enough that no overflow is possible.
    CVE-2021-41099:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-41099
        summary: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk.
            An integer overflow bug in the underlying string library can be used to
            corrupt the heap and potentially result with denial of service or remote
            code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default proto-max-bulk-len
            configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially
            crafted network payloads or commands. The problem is fixed in Redis versions
            6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem
            without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from
            modifying the proto-max-bulk-len configuration parameter. This can be
            done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET
            command.
    CVE-2021-32762:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-32762
        summary: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk.
            The redis-cli command line tool and redis-sentinel service may be vulnerable
            to integer overflow when parsing specially crafted large multi-bulk network
            replies. This is a result of a vulnerability in the underlying hiredis
            library which does not perform an overflow check before calling the calloc()
            heap allocation function. This issue only impacts systems with heap allocators
            that do not perform their own overflow checks. Most modern systems do
            and are therefore not likely to be affected. Furthermore, by default redis-sentinel
            uses the jemalloc allocator which is also not vulnerable. The problem
            is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14.
    CVE-2021-32687:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-32687
        summary: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk.
            An integer overflow bug affecting all versions of Redis can be exploited
            to corrupt the heap and potentially be used to leak arbitrary contents
            of the heap or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves
            changing the default set-max-intset-entries configuration parameter to
            a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands to manipulate
            sets. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14.
            An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the
            redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the set-max-intset-entries
            configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged
            users from using the CONFIG SET command.
    CVE-2021-32628:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-32628
        summary: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk.
            An integer overflow bug in the ziplist data structure used by all versions
            of Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with
            remote code execution. The vulnerability involves modifying the default
            ziplist configuration parameters (hash-max-ziplist-entries, hash-max-ziplist-value,
            zset-max-ziplist-entries or zset-max-ziplist-value) to a very large value,
            and then constructing specially crafted commands to create very large
            ziplists. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16, 5.0.14.
            An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the
            redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the above configuration
            parameters. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users
            from using the CONFIG SET command.
    CVE-2021-32627:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-32627
        summary: Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk.
            In affected versions an integer overflow bug in Redis can be exploited
            to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution.
            The vulnerability involves changing the default proto-max-bulk-len and
            client-query-buffer-limit configuration parameters to very large values
            and constructing specially crafted very large stream elements. The problem
            is fixed in Redis 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. For users unable to upgrade
            an additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the
            redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the proto-max-bulk-len
            configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged

            file under certain conditions when it is processed by ImageMagick. Red
            Hat Product Security marked this as Low because although it could potentially
            lead to an impact to application availability, no specific impact was
            shown in this case. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.
    CVE-2020-27756:

        summary: In IntensityCompare() of /magick/quantize.c, there are calls to PixelPacketIntensity()
            which could return overflowed values to the caller when ImageMagick processes
            a crafted input file. To mitigate this, the patch introduces and uses
            the ConstrainPixelIntensity() function, which forces the pixel intensities
            to be within the proper bounds in the event of an overflow. This flaw
            affects ImageMagick versions prior to 6.9.10-69 and 7.0.8-69.

            attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could
            trigger undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of
            type `unsigned long long` as well as a shift exponent that is too large
            for 64-bit type. This would most likely lead to an impact to application
            availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined
            behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
    CVE-2020-25676:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-25676
        summary: In CatromWeights(), MeshInterpolate(), InterpolatePixelChannel(),
            InterpolatePixelChannels(), and InterpolatePixelInfo(), which are all
            functions in /MagickCore/pixel.c, there were multiple unconstrained pixel
            offset calculations which were being used with the floor() function. These
            calculations produced undefined behavior in the form of out-of-range and
            integer overflows, as identified by UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. These
            instances of undefined behavior could be triggered by an attacker who
            is able to supply a crafted input file to be processed by ImageMagick.
            These issues could impact application availability or potentially cause
            other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick
            versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
    CVE-2020-25675:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-25675
        summary: In the CropImage() and CropImageToTiles() routines of MagickCore/transform.c,
            rounding calculations performed on unconstrained pixel offsets was causing
            undefined behavior in the form of integer overflow and out-of-range values
            as reported by UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. Such issues could cause a negative
            impact to application availability or other problems related to undefined
            behavior, in cases where ImageMagick processes untrusted input data. The
            upstream patch introduces functionality to constrain the pixel offsets
            and prevent these issues. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior
            to 7.0.9-0.

    CVE-2021-32714:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-32714
        summary: hyper is an HTTP library for Rust. In versions prior to 0.14.10,
            hyper's HTTP server and client code had a flaw that could trigger an integer
            overflow when decoding chunk sizes that are too big. This allows possible
            data loss, or if combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that allows chunk
            sizes larger than hyper does, can result in "request smuggling" or "desync
            attacks." The vulnerability is patched in version 0.14.10. Two possible
            workarounds exist. One may reject requests manually that contain a `Transfer-Encoding`
            header or ensure any upstream proxy rejects `Transfer-Encoding` chunk
            sizes greater than what fits in 64-bit unsigned integers.

        cve_id: CVE-2020-17444
        summary: An issue was discovered in picoTCP 1.7.0. The routine for processing
            the next header field (and deducing whether the IPv6 extension headers
            are valid) doesn't check whether the header extension length field would
            overflow. Therefore, if it wraps around to zero, iterating through the
            extension headers will not increment the current data pointer. This leads
            to an infinite loop and Denial-of-Service in pico_ipv6_check_headers_sequence()
            in pico_ipv6.c.

            size is shorter than 8 bytes. If the size of the incoming ICMPv6 request
            packet is shorter than this, the operation that calculates the size of
            the ICMPv6 echo replies has an integer wrap around, leading to memory

        cve_id: CVE-2020-17442
        summary: An issue was discovered in picoTCP 1.7.0. The code for parsing the
            hop-by-hop IPv6 extension headers does not validate the bounds of the
            extension header length value, which may result in Integer Wraparound.
            Therefore, a crafted extension header length value may cause Denial-of-Service

    CVE-2020-14344:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-14344
        summary: An integer overflow leading to a heap-buffer overflow was found in
            The X Input Method (XIM) client was implemented in libX11 before version
            1.6.10. As per upstream this is security relevant when setuid programs
            call XIM client functions while running with elevated privileges. No such
            programs are shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
    CVE-2020-14311:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-14311
        summary: There is an issue with grub2 before version 2.06 while handling symlink
            on ext filesystems. A filesystem containing a symbolic link with an inode
            size of UINT32_MAX causes an arithmetic overflow leading to a zero-sized
            memory allocation with subsequent heap-based buffer overflow.
    CVE-2020-14310:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-14310
        summary: There is an issue on grub2 before version 2.06 at function read_section_as_string().
            It expects a font name to be at max UINT32_MAX - 1 length in bytes but
            it doesn't verify it before proceed with buffer allocation to read the
            value from the font value. An attacker may leverage that by crafting a
            malicious font file which has a name with UINT32_MAX, leading to read_section_as_string()
            to an arithmetic overflow, zero-sized allocation and further heap-based
            buffer overflow.
    CVE-2020-14309:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-14309
        summary: There's an issue with grub2 in all versions before 2.06 when handling
            squashfs filesystems containing a symbolic link with name length of UINT32
            bytes in size. The name size leads to an arithmetic overflow leading to
            a zero-size allocation further causing a heap-based buffer overflow with
            attacker controlled data.
    CVE-2020-14308:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-14308
        summary: In grub2 versions before 2.06 the grub memory allocator doesn't check
            for possible arithmetic overflows on the requested allocation size. This
            leads the function to return invalid memory allocations which can be further
            used to cause possible integrity, confidentiality and availability impacts
            during the boot process.
    CVE-2020-15707:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-15707
        summary: Integer overflows were discovered in the functions grub_cmd_initrd
            and grub_initrd_init in the efilinux component of GRUB2, as shipped in
            Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu (the functionality is not included in GRUB2
            upstream), leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. These could be triggered
            by an extremely large number of arguments to the initrd command on 32-bit
            architectures, or a crafted filesystem with very large files on any architecture.
            An attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure
            Boot restrictions. This issue affects GRUB2 version 2.04 and prior versions.
    CVE-2020-15588:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-15588
        summary: An issue was discovered in the client side of Zoho ManageEngine Desktop
            Central 10.0.552.W. An attacker-controlled server can trigger an integer
            overflow in InternetSendRequestEx and InternetSendRequestByBitrate that
            leads to a heap-based buffer overflow and Remote Code Execution with SYSTEM
            privileges. This issue will occur only when untrusted communication is
            initiated with server. In cloud, Agent will always connect with trusted
            communication.
    CVE-2020-10929:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-10929
        summary: This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary
            code on affected installations of NETGEAR R6700 V1.0.4.84_10.0.58 routers.
            Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific
            flaw exists within the handling of string table file uploads. The issue
            results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which
            can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker
            can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the
            admin user. Was ZDI-CAN-9768.
    CVE-2020-15103:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-15103
        summary: In FreeRDP less than or equal to 2.1.2, an integer overflow exists
            due to missing input sanitation in rdpegfx channel. All FreeRDP clients
            are affected. The input rectangles from the server are not checked against
            local surface coordinates and blindly accepted. A malicious server can
            send data that will crash the client later on (invalid length arguments
            to a `memcpy`) This has been fixed in 2.2.0. As a workaround, stop using
            command line arguments /gfx, /gfx-h264 and /network:auto

    CVE-2020-12887:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-12887
        summary: Memory leaks were discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3
            when using the Arm mbed-coap library 5.1.5. The CoAP parser is responsible
            for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse()
            parses the CoAP option number field of all options present in the input
            packet. Each option number is calculated as a sum of the previous option
            number and a delta of the current option. The delta and the previous option
            number are expressed as unsigned 16-bit integers. Due to lack of overflow
            detection, it is possible to craft a packet that wraps the option number
            around and results in the same option number being processed again in
            a single packet. Certain options allocate memory by calling a memory allocation
            function. In the cases of COAP_OPTION_URI_QUERY, COAP_OPTION_URI_PATH,
            COAP_OPTION_LOCATION_QUERY, and COAP_OPTION_ETAG, there is no check on
            whether memory has already been allocated, which in conjunction with the
            option number integer overflow may lead to multiple assignments of allocated
            memory to a single pointer. This has been demonstrated to lead to memory
            leak by buffer orphaning. As a result, the memory is never freed.
    CVE-2020-14401:

        summary: Certain D-Link, Edimax, NETGEAR, TP-Link, Tenda, and Western Digital
            devices are affected by an integer overflow by an unauthenticated attacker.
            Remote code execution from the WAN interface (TCP port 20005) cannot be
            ruled out; however, exploitability was judged to be of "rather significant
            complexity" but not "impossible." The overflow is in SoftwareBus_dispatchNormalEPMsgOut
            in the KCodes NetUSB kernel module. Affected NETGEAR devices are D7800
            before 1.0.1.68, R6400v2 before 1.0.4.122, and R6700v3 before 1.0.4.122.
    CVE-2021-40417:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-40417
        summary: When parsing a file that is submitted to the DPDecoder service as
            a job, the service will use the combination of decoding parameters that
            were submitted with the job along with fields that were parsed for the
            submitted video by the R3D SDK to calculate the size of a heap buffer.
            Due to an integer overflow with regards to this calculation, this can
            result in an undersized heap buffer being allocated. When this heap buffer
            is written to, a heap-based buffer overflow will occur. This can result
            in code execution under the context of the application.

            a denial of service.
    CVE-2020-17396:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-17396
        summary: This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges
            on affected installations of Parallels Desktop 15.1.4. An attacker must
            first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target
            system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists
            within the prl_hypervisor module. The issue results from the lack of proper
            validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow
            before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability
            to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.

        summary: '** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** An issue was discovered in ReadyTalk
            Avian 1.2.0. The vm::arrayCopy method defined in classpath-common.h contains
            multiple boundary checks that are performed to prevent out-of-bounds memory

    CVE-2020-15137:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-15137
        summary: All versions of HoRNDIS are affected by an integer overflow in the
            RNDIS packet parsing routines. A malicious USB device can trigger disclosure
            of unrelated kernel memory to userspace applications on the host, or can
            cause the kernel to crash. Kernel memory disclosure is especially likely
            on 32-bit kernels; 64-bit kernels are more likely to crash on attempted
            exploitation. It is not believed that kernel memory corruption is possible,
            or that unattended kernel memory disclosure without the collaboration
            of a userspace program running on the host is possible. The vulnerability
            is in `HoRNDIS::receivePacket`. `msg_len`, `data_ofs`, and `data_len`
            can be controlled by an attached USB device, and a negative value of `data_ofs`
            can bypass the check for `(data_ofs + data_len + 8) > msg_len`, and subsequently
            can cause a wild pointer copy in the `mbuf_copyback` call. The software
            is not maintained and no patches are planned. Users of multi-tenant systems
            with HoRNDIS installed should only connect trusted USB devices to their
            system.

    CVE-2021-21309:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-21309
        summary: "Redis is an open-source, in-memory database that persists on disk.\
            \ In affected versions of Redis an integer overflow bug in 32-bit Redis\
            \ version 4.0 or newer could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially\
            \ result with remote code execution. Redis 4.0 or newer uses a configurable\
            \ limit for the maximum supported bulk input size. By default, it is 512MB\
            \ which is a safe value for all platforms. If the limit is significantly\
            \ increased, receiving a large request from a client may trigger several\
            \ integer overflow scenarios, which would result with buffer overflow\
            \ and heap corruption. We believe this could in certain conditions be\
            \ exploited for remote code execution. By default, authenticated Redis\
            \ users have access to all configuration parameters and can therefore\
            \ use the \u201CCONFIG SET proto-max-bulk-len\u201D to change the safe\
            \ default, making the system vulnerable. **This problem only affects 32-bit\
            \ Redis (on a 32-bit system, or as a 32-bit executable running on a 64-bit\
            \ system).** The problem is fixed in version 6.2, and the fix is back\
            \ ported to 6.0.11 and 5.0.11. Make sure you use one of these versions\
            \ if you are running 32-bit Redis. An additional workaround to mitigate\
            \ the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent\
            \ clients from directly executing `CONFIG SET`: Using Redis 6.0 or newer,\
            \ ACL configuration can be used to block the command. Using older versions,\
            \ the `rename-command` configuration directive can be used to rename the\
            \ command to a random string unknown to users, rendering it inaccessible.\
            \ Please note that this workaround may have an additional impact on users\
            \ or operational systems that expect `CONFIG SET` to behave in certain\
            \ ways."

    CVE-2019-1551:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-1551
        summary: There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure
            used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected.
            Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536,
            and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform
            and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just
            feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512
            private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly
            using the low level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME.
            Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u
            (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t).
    CVE-2019-19590:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-19590
        summary: In radare2 through 4.0, there is an integer overflow for the variable
            new_token_size in the function r_asm_massemble at libr/asm/asm.c. This
            integer overflow will result in a Use-After-Free for the buffer tokens,
            which can be filled with arbitrary malicious data after the free. This
            allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash)
            or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted input.
    CVE-2019-19307:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-19307
        summary: An integer overflow in parse_mqtt in mongoose.c in Cesanta Mongoose
            6.16 allows an attacker to achieve remote DoS (infinite loop), or possibly
            cause an out-of-bounds write, by sending a crafted MQTT protocol packet.
    CVE-2011-3631:
        cve_id: CVE-2011-3631
        summary: Hardlink before 0.1.2 has multiple integer overflows leading to heap-based
            buffer overflows because of the way string lengths concatenation is done
            in the calculation of the required memory space to be used. A remote attacker
            could provide a specially-crafted directory tree and trick the local user
            into consolidating it, leading to hardlink executable crash or potentially
            arbitrary code execution with user privileges.
    CVE-2019-5855:

    CVE-2019-17546:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-17546
        summary: tif_getimage.c in LibTIFF through 4.0.10, as used in GDAL through
            3.0.1 and other products, has an integer overflow that potentially causes
            a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted RGBA image, related to a "Negative-size-param"
            condition.
    CVE-2019-17451:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-17451
        summary: An issue was discovered in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library
            (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. It is an integer overflow
            leading to a SEGV in _bfd_dwarf2_find_nearest_line in dwarf2.c, as demonstrated
            by nm.
    CVE-2019-16905:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-16905
        summary: 'OpenSSH 7.7 through 7.9 and 8.x before 8.1, when compiled with an
            experimental key type, has a pre-authentication integer overflow if a
            client or server is configured to use a crafted XMSS key. This leads to
            memory corruption and local code execution because of an error in the
            XMSS key parsing algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation is considered
            experimental in all released OpenSSH versions, and there is no supported
            way to enable it when building portable OpenSSH.'
    CVE-2019-12693:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-12693
        summary: A vulnerability in the Secure Copy (SCP) feature of Cisco Adaptive
            Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an authenticated, remote
            attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability
            is due to the use of an incorrect data type for a length variable. An
            attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating the transfer of
            a large file to an affected device via SCP. To exploit this vulnerability,
            the attacker would need to have valid privilege level 15 credentials on
            the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
            cause the length variable to roll over, which could cause the affected
            device to crash.
    CVE-2019-16508:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-16508
        summary: The Imagination Technologies driver for Chrome OS before R74-11895.B,
            R75 before R75-12105.B, and R76 before R76-12208.0.0 allows attackers
            to trigger an Integer Overflow and gain privileges via a malicious application.
            This occurs because of intentional access for the GPU process to /dev/dri/card1
            and the PowerVR ioctl handler, as demonstrated by PVRSRVBridgeSyncPrimOpCreate.
    CVE-2019-11927:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-11927
        summary: An integer overflow in WhatsApp media parsing libraries allows a
            remote attacker to perform an out-of-bounds write on the heap via specially-crafted
            EXIF tags in WEBP images. This issue affects WhatsApp for Android before
            version 2.19.143 and WhatsApp for iOS before version 2.19.100.

            Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
            a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful
            exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory, causing the
            device to reload. Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit
            this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as
            the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).

    CVE-2018-14618:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-14618
        summary: curl before version 7.61.1 is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the
            NTLM authentication code. The internal function Curl_ntlm_core_mk_nt_hash
            multiplies the length of the password by two (SUM) to figure out how large
            temporary storage area to allocate from the heap. The length value is
            then subsequently used to iterate over the password and generate output
            into the allocated storage buffer. On systems with a 32 bit size_t, the
            math to calculate SUM triggers an integer overflow when the password length
            exceeds 2GB (2^31 bytes). This integer overflow usually causes a very
            small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very huge
            one, making the use of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow. (This
            bug is almost identical to CVE-2017-8816.)

    CVE-2018-12896:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-12896
        summary: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. An Integer
            Overflow in kernel/time/posix-timers.c in the POSIX timer code is caused
            by the way the overrun accounting works. Depending on interval and expiry
            time values, the overrun can be larger than INT_MAX, but the accounting
            is int based. This basically makes the accounting values, which are visible
            to user space via timer_getoverrun(2) and siginfo::si_overrun, random.
            For example, a local user can cause a denial of service (signed integer
            overflow) via crafted mmap, futex, timer_create, and timer_settime system
            calls.

    CVE-2017-7657:
        cve_id: CVE-2017-7657
        summary: In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations),
            and 9.4.x (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled),
            transfer-encoding chunks are handled poorly. The chunk length parsing
            was vulnerable to an integer overflow. Thus a large chunk size could be
            interpreted as a smaller chunk size and content sent as chunk body could
            be interpreted as a pipelined request. If Jetty was deployed behind an
            intermediary that imposed some authorization and that intermediary allowed
            arbitrarily large chunks to be passed on unchanged, then this flaw could
            be used to bypass the authorization imposed by the intermediary as the
            fake pipelined request would not be interpreted by the intermediary as
            a request.

    CVE-2016-4298:
        cve_id: CVE-2016-4298
        summary: When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure
            within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will attempt to allocate space
            for a list of elements using a length from the file. When calculating
            this length, an integer overflow can be made to occur which will cause
            the buffer to be undersized when the application tries to copy file data
            into the object containing this structure. This allows one to overwrite
            contiguous data in the heap which can lead to code-execution under the
            context of the application.
    CVE-2016-4291:
        cve_id: CVE-2016-4291
        summary: When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure
            within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will use a field from the structure
            in an operation that can cause the integer to overflow. This result is
            then used to allocate memory to copy file data in. Due to the lack of
            bounds checking on the integer, the allocated memory buffer can be made
            to be undersized at which point the reading of file data will write outside
            the bounds of the buffer. This can lead to code execution under the context
            of the application.
    CVE-2016-4290:
        cve_id: CVE-2016-4290
        summary: When opening a Hangul HShow Document (.hpt) and processing a structure
            within the document, Hancom Office 2014 will attempt to allocate space
            for a block of data within the file. When calculating this length, the
            application will use a value from the file and add a constant to it without
            checking whether the addition of the constant will cause the integer to
            overflow which will cause the buffer to be undersized when the application
            tries to copy file data into it. This allows one to overwrite contiguous
            data in the heap which can lead to code-execution under the context of
            the application.
    CVE-2015-7848:
        cve_id: CVE-2015-7848
        summary: An integer overflow can occur in NTP-dev.4.3.70 leading to an out-of-bounds
            memory copy operation when processing a specially crafted private mode
            packet. The crafted packet needs to have the correct message authentication
            code and a valid timestamp. When processed by the NTP daemon, it leads
            to an immediate crash.

    CVE-2021-29605:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-29605
        summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
            The TFLite code for allocating `TFLiteIntArray`s is vulnerable to an integer
            overflow issue(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4ceffae632721e52bf3501b736e4fe9d1221cdfa/tensorflow/lite/c/common.c#L24-L27).
            An attacker can craft a model such that the `size` multiplier is so large
            that the return value overflows the `int` datatype and becomes negative.
            In turn, this results in invalid value being given to `malloc`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4ceffae632721e52bf3501b736e4fe9d1221cdfa/tensorflow/lite/c/common.c#L47-L52).
            In this case, `ret->size` would dereference an invalid pointer. The fix
            will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
            on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow
            2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
    CVE-2021-29601:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-29601
        summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
            The TFLite implementation of concatenation is vulnerable to an integer
            overflow issue(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/7b7352a724b690b11bfaae2cd54bc3907daf6285/tensorflow/lite/kernels/concatenation.cc#L70-L76).
            An attacker can craft a model such that the dimensions of one of the concatenation
            input overflow the values of `int`. TFLite uses `int` to represent tensor
            dimensions, whereas TF uses `int64`. Hence, valid TF models can trigger
            an integer overflow when converted to TFLite format. The fix will be included
            in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
            2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these
            are also affected and still in supported range.

            An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in caused
            by an integer overflow in constructing a new tensor shape. This is because

            builds a dense shape without checking that the dimensions would not result
            in overflow. The `TensorShape` constructor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/6f9896890c4c703ae0a0845394086e2e1e523299/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.cc#L183-L188)
            uses a `CHECK` operation which triggers when `InitDims`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/6f9896890c4c703ae0a0845394086e2e1e523299/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.cc#L212-L296)
            returns a non-OK status. This is a legacy implementation of the constructor
            and operations should use `BuildTensorShapeBase` or `AddDimWithStatus`
            to prevent `CHECK`-failures in the presence of overflows. The fix will

    CVE-2018-16890:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-16890
        summary: libcurl versions from 7.36.0 to before 7.64.0 is vulnerable to a
            heap buffer out-of-bounds read. The function handling incoming NTLM type-2
            messages (`lib/vauth/ntlm.c:ntlm_decode_type2_target`) does not validate
            incoming data correctly and is subject to an integer overflow vulnerability.
            Using that overflow, a malicious or broken NTLM server could trick libcurl
            to accept a bad length + offset combination that would lead to a buffer
            read out-of-bounds.

            a 32-bit reference counter, potentially causing dhcpd to crash. Affects
            ISC DHCP 4.1.0 -> 4.1-ESV-R15, 4.2.0 -> 4.2.8, 4.3.0 -> 4.3.6, 4.4.0.
    CVE-2020-27764:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-27764
        summary: In /MagickCore/statistic.c, there are several areas in ApplyEvaluateOperator()
            where a size_t cast should have been a ssize_t cast, which causes out-of-range
            values under some circumstances when a crafted input file is processed
            by ImageMagick. Red Hat Product Security marked this as Low severity because
            although it could potentially lead to an impact to application availability,
            no specific impact was shown in this case. This flaw affects ImageMagick
            versions prior to 6.9.10-69.
    CVE-2020-27762:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-27762
        summary: A flaw was found in ImageMagick in coders/hdr.c. An attacker who
            submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger
            undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type `unsigned
            char`. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability,
            but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.
            This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to ImageMagick 7.0.8-68.
    CVE-2020-27761:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-27761
        summary: WritePALMImage() in /coders/palm.c used size_t casts in several areas
            of a calculation which could lead to values outside the range of representable
            type `unsigned long` undefined behavior when a crafted input file was
            processed by ImageMagick. The patch casts to `ssize_t` instead to avoid
            this issue. Red Hat Product Security marked the Severity as Low because
            although it could potentially lead to an impact to application availability,
            no specific impact was shown in this case. This flaw affects ImageMagick
            versions prior to ImageMagick 7.0.9-0.
    CVE-2020-27759:

            being casted to int and returned, which in some cases caused a value outside
            the range of type `int` to be returned. The flaw could be triggered by
            a crafted input file under certain conditions when processed by ImageMagick.
            Red Hat Product Security marked this as Low severity because although
            it could potentially lead to an impact to application availability, no
            specific impact was shown in this case. This flaw affects ImageMagick
            versions prior to 7.0.8-68.

    CVE-2020-12826:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-12826
        summary: A signal access-control issue was discovered in the Linux kernel
            before 5.6.5, aka CID-7395ea4e65c2. Because exec_id in include/linux/sched.h
            is only 32 bits, an integer overflow can interfere with a do_notify_parent
            protection mechanism. A child process can send an arbitrary signal to
            a parent process in a different security domain. Exploitation limitations
            include the amount of elapsed time before an integer overflow occurs,
            and the lack of scenarios where signals to a parent process present a
            substantial operational threat.

        summary: Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure
            store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. An integer overflow
            bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer could be exploited using the `STRALGO
            LCS` command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code
            execution. The problem is fixed in version 6.2.3 and 6.0.13. An additional
            workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable
            is to use ACL configuration to prevent clients from using the `STRALGO
            LCS` command.

    CVE-2021-32625:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-32625
        summary: Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure
            store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. An integer overflow
            bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer, could be exploited using the STRALGO
            LCS command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code
            execution. This is a result of an incomplete fix by CVE-2021-29477. The
            problem is fixed in version 6.2.4 and 6.0.14. An additional workaround
            to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is
            to use ACL configuration to prevent clients from using the STRALGO LCS
            command. On 64 bit systems which have the fixes of CVE-2021-29477 (6.2.3
            or 6.0.13), it is sufficient to make sure that the proto-max-bulk-len

        summary: There's a flaw in lz4. An attacker who submits a crafted file to
            an application linked with lz4 may be able to trigger an integer overflow,
            leading to calling of memmove() on a negative size argument, causing an
            out-of-bounds write and/or a crash. The greatest impact of this flaw is
            to availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity
            as well.

        summary: An issue was discovered in Envoy through 1.71.1. There is a remotely
            exploitable integer overflow in which a very large grpc-timeout value
            leads to unexpected timeout calculations.
    CVE-2021-43784:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-43784
        summary: runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according
            to the OCI specification. In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization
            system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C`
            portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers).
            In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the
            possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the
            byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte
            array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute
            contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration.
            This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the
            configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass
            the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own
            netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted
            are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to
            run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc
            version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try
            disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be
            noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable
            namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.

            segfaults and `CHECK`-fail crashes if they can change saved checkpoints
            from outside of TensorFlow. This is because the checkpoints loading infrastructure
            is missing validation for invalid file formats. The fixes will be included
            in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick these commits on TensorFlow

        summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
            versions TensorFlow allows tensor to have a large number of dimensions
            and each dimension can be as large as desired. However, the total number
            of elements in a tensor must fit within an `int64_t`. If an overflow occurs,
            `MultiplyWithoutOverflow` would return a negative result. In the majority
            of TensorFlow codebase this then results in a `CHECK`-failure. Newer constructs
            exist which return a `Status` instead of crashing the binary. This is
            similar to CVE-2021-29584. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0.
            We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2,

    CVE-2018-5865:

        summary: While processing a debug log event from firmware in all Android releases
            from CAF using the Linux kernel (Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM,
            QRD Android) before security patch level 2018-07-05, an integer underflow

    CVE-2018-12025:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-12025
        summary: 'The transferFrom function of a smart contract implementation for
            FuturXE (FXE), an Ethereum ERC20 token, allows attackers to accomplish
            an unauthorized transfer of digital assets because of a logic error. The
            developer messed up with the boolean judgment - if the input value is
            smaller than or equal to allowed value, the transfer session would stop
            execution by returning false. This makes no sense, because the transferFrom()
            function should require the transferring value to not exceed the allowed
            value in the first place. Suppose this function asks for the allowed value
            to be smaller than the input. Then, the attacker could easily ignore the
            allowance: after this condition, the `allowed[from][msg.sender] -= value;`
            would cause an underflow because the allowed part is smaller than the
            value. The attacker could transfer any amount of FuturXe tokens of any
            accounts to an appointed account (the `_to` address) because the allowed
            value is initialized to 0, and the attacker could bypass this restriction
            even without the victim''s private key.'

    CVE-2023-31137:
        cve_id: CVE-2023-31137
        summary: 'MaraDNS is open-source software that implements the Domain Name
            System (DNS). In version 3.5.0024 and prior, a remotely exploitable integer
            underflow vulnerability in the DNS packet decompression function allows
            an attacker to cause a Denial of Service by triggering an abnormal program
            termination.


            The vulnerability exists in the `decomp_get_rddata` function within the
            `Decompress.c` file. When handling a DNS packet with an Answer RR of qtype
            16 (TXT record) and any qclass, if the `rdlength` is smaller than `rdata`,
            the result of the line `Decompress.c:886` is a negative number `len =
            rdlength - total;`. This value is then passed to the `decomp_append_bytes`
            function without proper validation, causing the program to attempt to
            allocate a massive chunk of memory that is impossible to allocate. Consequently,
            the program exits with an error code of 64, causing a Denial of Service.


            One proposed fix for this vulnerability is to patch `Decompress.c:887`
            by breaking `if(len <= 0)`, which has been incorporated in version 3.5.0036
            via commit bab062bde40b2ae8a91eecd522e84d8b993bab58.'

            to version 2022.10, an attacker can send a crafted frame to the device
            resulting in a large out of bounds write beyond the packet buffer. The
            write will create a hard fault exception after reaching the last page
            of RAM. The hard fault is not handled and the system will be stuck until

        summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
            versions the Keras pooling layers can trigger a segfault if the size of

    CVE-2021-37636:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-37636
        summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
            In affected versions the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SparseDenseCwiseDiv`
            is vulnerable to a division by 0 error. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1bc56203f21a5a4995311825ffaba7a670d7747/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_dense_binary_op_shared.cc#L56)
            uses a common class for all binary operations but fails to treat the division
            by 0 case separately. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit d9204be9f49520cdaaeb2541d1dc5187b23f31d9.
            The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick
            this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4,

    CVE-2021-34335:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-34335
        summary: Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
            deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. A floating point
            exception (FPE) due to an integer divide by zero was found in Exiv2 versions
            v0.27.4 and earlier. The FPE is triggered when Exiv2 is used to print
            the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit
            the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the
            victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug
            is only triggered when printing the interpreted (translated) data, which
            is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation that requires an extra command
            line option (`-p t` or `-P t`). The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5.

            This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/828f346274841fa7505f7020e88ca36c22e557ab/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc#L295-L297)
            performs a division based on the last dimension of the `x` tensor. Since
            this is controlled by the user, an attacker can trigger a denial of service.
            The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick
            this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and
            TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

        cve_id: CVE-2021-29550
        summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
            An attacker can cause a runtime division by zero error and denial of service
            in `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPool`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L85-L89)
            computes a divisor quantity by dividing two user controlled values. The
            user controls the values of `input_size[i]` and `pooling_ratio_[i]` (via
            the `value.shape()` and `pooling_ratio` arguments). If the value in `input_size[i]`
            is smaller than the `pooling_ratio_[i]`, then the floor operation results
            in `output_size[i]` being 0. The `DCHECK_GT` line is a no-op outside of
            debug mode, so in released versions of TF this does not trigger. Later,
            these computed values are used as arguments(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L96-L99)
            to `GeneratePoolingSequence`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_pool_common.cc#L100-L108).
            There, the first computation is a division in a modulo operation. Since
            `output_length` can be 0, this results in runtime crashing. The fix will
            be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
            TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4,

            computes a modulo operation without validating that the divisor is not
            zero. Since `vector_num_elements` is determined based on input shapes(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/6f26b3f3418201479c264f2a02000880d8df151c/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_add_op.cc#L522-L544),
            a user can trigger scenarios where this quantity is 0. The fix will be

            images. An attacker who has compromised a registry and added a high number
            of signatures to an artifact can cause denial of service of services on
            the machine, if a user runs notation inspect command on the same machine.
            The problem has been fixed in the release v1.0.0-rc.6. Users should upgrade
            their notation packages to v1.0.0-rc.6 or above. Users are advised to
            upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may restrict container registries to
            a set of secure and trusted container registries.

    CVE-2023-27484:
        cve_id: CVE-2023-27484
        summary: crossplane-runtime is a set of go libraries used to build Kubernetes
            controllers in Crossplane and its related stacks. In affected versions
            an already highly privileged user able to create or update Compositions
            can specify an arbitrarily high index in a patch's `ToFieldPath`, which
            could lead to excessive memory usage once such Composition is selected
            for a Composite resource. Compositions allow users to specify patches
            inserting elements into arrays at an arbitrary index. When a Composition
            is selected for a Composite Resource, patches are evaluated and if a specified
            index is greater than the current size of the target slice, Crossplane
            will grow that slice up to the specified index, which could lead to an
            excessive amount of memory usage and therefore the Pod being OOM-Killed.
            The index is already capped to the maximum value for a uint32 (4294967295)
            when parsed, but that is still an unnecessarily large value. This issue
            has been addressed in versions 1.11.2, 1.10.3, and 1.9.2. Users are advised
            to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can restrict write privileges on Compositions
            to only admin users as a workaround.
    CVE-2023-27483:
        cve_id: CVE-2023-27483
        summary: crossplane-runtime is a set of go libraries used to build Kubernetes
            controllers in Crossplane and its related stacks. An out of memory panic
            vulnerability has been discovered in affected versions. Applications that
            use the `Paved` type's `SetValue` method with user provided input without
            proper validation might use excessive amounts of memory and cause an out
            of memory panic. In the fieldpath package, the Paved.SetValue method sets
            a value on the Paved object according to the provided path, without any
            validation. This allows setting values in slices at any provided index,
            which grows the target array up to the requested index, the index is currently
            capped at max uint32 (4294967295) given how indexes are parsed, but that
            is still an unnecessarily large value. If callers are not validating paths'
            indexes on their own, which most probably are not going to do, given that
            the input is parsed directly in the SetValue method, this could allow
            users to consume arbitrary amounts of memory. Applications that do not
            use the `Paved` type's `SetValue` method are not affected. This issue
            has been addressed in versions 0.16.1 and 0.19.2. Users are advised to
            upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can parse and validate the path before
            passing it to the `SetValue` method of the `Paved` type, constraining
            the index size as deemed appropriate.

        summary: A vulnerability in the DNS functionality of Cisco Nexus Dashboard
            Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial
            of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to the improper
            processing of DNS requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
            by sending a continuous stream of DNS requests to an affected device.
            A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the coredns service
            to stop working or cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

        summary: An attacker can craft a malformed TIFF image which will consume a
            significant amount of memory when passed to DecodeConfig. This could lead
            to a denial of service.
    CVE-2022-41725:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-41725
        summary: A denial of service is possible from excessive resource consumption
            in net/http and mime/multipart. Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm
            can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also
            affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods
            FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes
            a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing "up to maxMemory bytes
            +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory". File parts which cannot
            be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable
            10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially
            open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not
            properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map
            entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously
            crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained
            no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively
            small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With
            fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead,
            and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes
            of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is
            high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at
            most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a
            single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation
            states, "If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be
            an *os.File.". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than
            one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The
            previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled
            with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should
            be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call
            it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers
            can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.

            under a malicious delegation point where a considerable number of unresponsive
            NS records reside. It can trigger high CPU usage in some resolver implementations
            that continually look in the cache for resolved NS records in that delegation.
            This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service
            in orchestrated attacks. Unbound does not suffer from high CPU usage,
            but resources are still needed for resolving the malicious delegation.
            Unbound will keep trying to resolve the record until hard limits are reached.
            Based on the nature of the attack and the replies, different limits could
            be reached. From version 1.16.3 on, Unbound introduces fixes for better
            performance when under load, by cutting opportunistic queries for nameserver
            discovery and DNSKEY prefetching and limiting the number of times a delegation
            point can issue a cache lookup for missing records.

    CVE-2023-25151:
        cve_id: CVE-2023-25151
        summary: opentelemetry-go-contrib is a collection of extensions for OpenTelemetry-Go.
            The v0.38.0 release of `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp`
            uses the `httpconv.ServerRequest` function to annotate metric measurements
            for the `http.server.request_content_length`, `http.server.response_content_length`,
            and `http.server.duration` instruments. The `ServerRequest` function sets
            the `http.target` attribute value to be the whole request URI (including
            the query string)[^1]. The metric instruments do not "forget" previous
            measurement attributes when `cumulative` temporality is used, this means
            the cardinality of the measurements allocated is directly correlated with
            the unique URIs handled. If the query string is constantly random, this
            will result in a constant increase in memory allocation that can be used
            in a denial-of-service attack. This issue has been addressed in version
            0.39.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for

        summary: 'Synapse before 1.52.0 with URL preview functionality enabled will
            attempt to generate URL previews for media stream URLs without properly
            limiting connection time. Connections will only be terminated after `max_spider_size`
            (default: 10M) bytes have been downloaded, which can in some cases lead
            to long-lived connections towards the streaming media server (for instance,
            Icecast). This can cause excessive traffic and connections toward such
            servers if their stream URL is, for example, posted to a large room with
            many Synapse instances with URL preview enabled. Version 1.52.0 implements
            a timeout mechanism which will terminate URL preview connections after

        summary: A vulnerability in the processing of SSH connections of Cisco Firepower
            Management Center (FMC) and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
            could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
            (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper
            error handling when an SSH session fails to be established. An attacker
            could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of crafted SSH
            connections to the instance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
            to cause resource exhaustion, resulting in a reboot on the affected device.
    CVE-2022-40735:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-40735
        summary: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents
            that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive, because
            the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that "(appropriately) short
            exponents" can be used when there are adequate subgroup constraints, and
            these short exponents can lead to less expensive calculations than for
            long exponents. This issue is different from CVE-2002-20001 because it
            is based on an observation about exponent size, rather than an observation
            about numbers that are not public keys. The specific situations in which
            calculation expense would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend
            on the protocol (e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details.
            In general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side
            resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. Finally,
            it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability and CVE-2002-20001
            together.

        summary: An issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic
            algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC
            3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented
            to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often
            supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor;
            in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the
            client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname.
            For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header
            of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1,
            3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.

    CVE-2022-20937:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-20937
        summary: A vulnerability in a feature that monitors RADIUS requests on Cisco
            Identity Services Engine (ISE) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
            remote attacker to negatively affect the performance of an affected device.
            This vulnerability is due to insufficient management of system resources.
            An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by taking actions that cause
            Cisco ISE Software to receive specific RADIUS traffic. A successful and
            sustained exploit of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to cause
            reduced performance of the affected device, resulting in significant delays
            to RADIUS authentications. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.
    CVE-2022-3807:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-3807
        summary: A vulnerability was found in Axiomatic Bento4. It has been rated
            as problematic. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of
            the component Incomplete Fix CVE-2019-13238. The manipulation leads to
            resource consumption. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit
            has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier of this
            vulnerability is VDB-212660.
    CVE-2022-36078:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-36078
        summary: Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The
            vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be exploited
            to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size value, which
            can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole program. When using
            `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse unchecked (or wrong type of)
            data from untrusted sources of input (e.g. the blockchain) into slices,
            it's possible to allocate memory with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)`
            method is used to parse data into a structure that is or contains slices
            of values, the length of the slice was previously read directly from the
            data itself without any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was
            allocated. This could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory
            with excessive size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher.
            A workaround is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse
            the data, but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads
            and checks the length of any slice.

    CVE-2022-1677:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-1677
        summary: In OpenShift Container Platform, a user with permissions to create
            or modify Routes can craft a payload that inserts a malformed entry into
            one of the cluster router's HAProxy configuration files. This malformed
            entry can match any arbitrary hostname, or all hostnames in the cluster,
            and direct traffic to an arbitrary application within the cluster, including
            one under attacker control.

    CVE-2022-36055:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-36055
        summary: Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured
            Kubernetes resources. Fuzz testing, provided by the CNCF, identified input
            to functions in the _strvals_ package that can cause an out of memory
            panic. The _strvals_ package contains a parser that turns strings in to
            Go structures. The _strvals_ package converts these strings into structures
            Go can work with. Some string inputs can cause array data structures to
            be created causing an out of memory panic. Applications that use the _strvals_
            package in the Helm SDK to parse user supplied input can suffer a Denial
            of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from.
            The Helm Client will panic with input to `--set`, `--set-string`, and
            other value setting flags that causes an out of memory panic. Helm is
            not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of
            the Helm client. This issue has been resolved in 3.9.4. SDK users can
            validate strings supplied by users won't create large arrays causing significant
            memory usage before passing them to the _strvals_ functions.

    CVE-2022-31080:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-31080
        summary: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized
            application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions
            1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, a large response received by the viaduct WSClient
            can cause a DoS from memory exhaustion. The entire body of the response
            is being read into memory which could allow an attacker to send a request
            that returns a response with a large body. The consequence of the exhaustion
            is that the process which invokes a WSClient will be in a denial of service.
            The software is affected If users who are authenticated to the edge side
            connect to `cloudhub` from the edge side through WebSocket protocol. This
            bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There are currently
            no known workarounds.
    CVE-2022-31079:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-31079
        summary: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized
            application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions
            1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the Cloud Stream server and the Edge Stream
            server reads the entire message into memory without imposing a limit on
            the size of this message. An attacker can exploit this by sending a large
            message to exhaust memory and cause a DoS. The Cloud Stream server and
            the Edge Stream server are under DoS attack in this case. The consequence
            of the exhaustion is that the CloudCore and EdgeCore will be in a denial
            of service. Only an authenticated user can cause this issue. It will be
            affected only when users enable `cloudStream` module in the config file
            `cloudcore.yaml` and enable `edgeStream` module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.
            This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround,
            disable cloudStream module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml` and disable
            edgeStream module in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.
    CVE-2022-31078:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-31078
        summary: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized
            application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions
            1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the CloudCore Router does not impose a limit
            on the size of responses to requests made by the REST handler. An attacker
            could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response
            with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API,
            the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle. The handle
            will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence
            of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service. Only
            an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected
            only when users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.
            This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround,
            disable the router switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.
    CVE-2022-31075:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-31075
        summary: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized
            application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions
            1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, EdgeCore may be susceptible to a DoS attack
            on CloudHub if an attacker was to send a well-crafted HTTP request to
            `/edge.crt`. If an attacker can send a well-crafted HTTP request to CloudHub,
            and that request has a very large body, that request can crash the HTTP
            service through a memory exhaustion vector. The request body is being
            read into memory, and a body that is larger than the available memory
            can lead to a successful attack. Because the request would have to make
            it through authorization, only authorized users may perform this attack.
            The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudHub will be in denial of
            service. KubeEdge is affected only when users enable the CloudHub module
            in the file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1,
            1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the CloudHub switch in the
            config file `cloudcore.yaml`.

        summary: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized
            application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions
            1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, several endpoints in the Cloud AdmissionController
            may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very
            large Body is sent to it. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the
            Cloud AdmissionController will be in denial of service. This bug has been
            fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There is currently no known

        summary: KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized
            application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to versions
            1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the ServiceBus server on the edge side may
            be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing a very large
            Body is sent to it. It is possible for the node to be exhausted of memory.
            The consequence of the exhaustion is that other services on the node,
            e.g. other containers, will be unable to allocate memory and thus causing
            a denial of service. Malicious apps accidentally pulled by users on the
            host and have the access to send HTTP requests to localhost may make an
            attack. It will be affected only when users enable the `ServiceBus` module
            in the config file `edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge
            1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the `ServiceBus` module
            in the config file `edgecore.yaml`.

            handling of multiple simultaneous device registrations on Cisco SSM On-Prem.
            An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple device
            registration requests to Cisco SSM On-Prem. A successful exploit could
            allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on an affected device.
    CVE-2022-31129:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-31129
        summary: moment is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating,
            and formatting dates. Affected versions of moment were found to use an
            inefficient parsing algorithm. Specifically using string-to-date parsing
            in moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing, which is tried by default)
            has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific inputs. Users may notice a
            noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs above 10k characters. Users
            who pass user-provided strings without sanity length checks to moment
            constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks. The problem is patched
            in 2.29.4, the patch can be applied to all affected versions with minimal
            tweaking. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should
            consider limiting date lengths accepted from user input.

    CVE-2014-3648:
        cve_id: CVE-2014-3648
        summary: The simplepush server iterates through the application installations
            and pushes a notification to the server provided by deviceToken. But this
            is user controlled. If a bogus applications is registered with bad deviceTokens,
            one can generate endless exceptions when those endpoints can't be reached
            or can slow the server down by purposefully wasting it's time with slow
            endpoints. Similarly, one can provide whatever HTTP end point they want.
            This turns the server into a DDOS vector or an anonymizer for the posting
            of malware and so on.
    CVE-2022-31110:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-31110
        summary: RSSHub is an open source, extensible RSS feed generator. In commits
            prior to 5c4177441417 passing some special values to the `filter` and
            `filterout` parameters can cause an abnormally high CPU. This results
            in an impact on the performance of the servers and RSSHub services which
            may lead to a denial of service. This issue has been fixed in commit 5c4177441417

    CVE-2022-26477:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-26477
        summary: The Security Team noticed that the termination condition of the for
            loop in the readExternal method is a controllable variable, which, if
            tampered with, may lead to CPU exhaustion. As a fix, we added an upper
            bound and termination condition in the read and write logic. We classify
            it as a "low-priority but useful improvement". SystemDS is a distributed
            system and needs to serialize/deserialize data but in many code paths
            (e.g., on Spark broadcast/shuffle or writing to sequence files) the byte
            stream is anyway protected by additional CRC fingerprints. In this particular
            case though, the number of decoders is upper-bounded by twice the number
            of columns, which means an attacker would need to modify two entries in
            the byte stream in a consistent manner. By adding these checks robustness
            was strictly improved with almost zero overhead. These code changes are
            available in versions higher than 2.2.1.
    CVE-2022-31016:

            CD versions v0.7.0 and later are vulnerable to an uncontrolled memory
            consumption bug, allowing an authorized malicious user to crash the repo-server
            service, resulting in a Denial of Service. The attacker must be an authenticated
            Argo CD user authorized to deploy Applications from a repository which
            contains (or can be made to contain) a large file. The fix for this vulnerability
            is available in versions 2.3.5, 2.2.10, 2.1.16, and later. There are no
            known workarounds. Users are recommended to upgrade.

    CVE-2022-39278:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-39278
        summary: Istio is an open platform-independent service mesh that provides
            traffic management, policy enforcement, and telemetry collection. Prior
            to versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9, the Istio control plane, istiod,
            is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker
            that sends a specially crafted or oversized message which results in the
            control plane crashing when the Kubernetes validating or mutating webhook
            service is exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017,
            but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple
            installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster,
            limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially external
            istiod topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. Versions
            1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9 contain patches for this issue. There are no
            effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. This bug is due to an error in
            `regexp.Compile` in Go.

        summary: HTTP and MIME header parsing can allocate large amounts of memory,
            even when parsing small inputs, potentially leading to a denial of service.
            Certain unusual patterns of input data can cause the common function used
            to parse HTTP and MIME headers to allocate substantially more memory than
            required to hold the parsed headers. An attacker can exploit this behavior
            to cause an HTTP server to allocate large amounts of memory from a small
            request, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and a denial of service.
            With fix, header parsing now correctly allocates only the memory required
            to hold parsed headers.

    CVE-2023-28837:
        cve_id: CVE-2023-28837
        summary: Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django.
            Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in Wagtail's
            handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images and documents,
            files are loaded into memory during upload for additional processing.
            A user with access to upload images or documents through the Wagtail admin
            interface could upload a file so large that it results in a crash of denial
            of service. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor
            without access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin
            users with permission to upload images or documents. Image uploads are
            restricted to 10MB by default, however this validation only happens on
            the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code. Patched versions
            have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2). Site owners who
            are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to add extra
            protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded files.

            Impact A polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded
            resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. ### Proof of concept
            ``` $ ~/cmark-gfm$ python3 -c ''pad = "_" * 100000; print(pad + "." +
            pad, end="")'' | time ./build/src/cmark-gfm --to plaintext ``` Increasing
            the number 10000 in the above commands causes the running time to increase
            quadratically. ### Patches This vulnerability have been patched in 0.29.0.gfm.10.
            ### Note on cmark and cmark-gfm XXX: TBD [cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm)
            is a fork of [cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) that adds the
            GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions. The two codebases have diverged over
            time, but share a common core. These bugs affect both `cmark` and `cmark-gfm`.

    CVE-2023-28846:
        cve_id: CVE-2023-28846
        summary: 'Unpoly is a JavaScript framework for server-side web applications.
            There is a possible Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the `unpoly-rails`
            gem that implements the Unpoly server protocol for Rails applications.
            This issues affects Rails applications that operate as an upstream of
            a load balancer''s that uses passive health checks. The `unpoly-rails`
            gem echoes the request URL as an `X-Up-Location` response header. By making
            a request with exceedingly long URLs (paths or query string), an attacker
            can cause unpoly-rails to write a exceedingly large response header. If
            the response header is too large to be parsed by a load balancer downstream
            of the Rails application, it may cause the load balancer to remove the
            upstream from a load balancing group. This causes that application instance
            to become unavailable until a configured timeout is reached or until an
            active healthcheck succeeds. This issue has been fixed and released as
            version 2.7.2.2 which is available via RubyGems and GitHub. Users unable
            to upgrade may: Configure your load balancer to use active health checks,
            e.g. by periodically requesting a route with a known response that indicates
            healthiness; Configure your load balancer so the maximum size of response
            headers is at least twice the maximum size of a URL; or instead of changing
            your server configuration you may also configure your Rails application
            to delete redundant `X-Up-Location` headers set by unpoly-rails.'

    CVE-2022-36114:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-36114
        summary: 'Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. It
            was discovered that Cargo did not limit the amount of data extracted from
            compressed archives. An attacker could upload to an alternate registry
            a specially crafted package that extracts way more data than its size
            (also known as a "zip bomb"), exhausting the disk space on the machine
            using Cargo to download the package. Note that by design Cargo allows
            code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural macros.
            The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset of the
            possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your dependencies must
            still be trusted if you want to be protected from attacks, as it''s possible
            to perform the same attacks with build scripts and procedural macros.
            The vulnerability is present in all versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be
            released on September 22nd, will include a fix for it. Since the vulnerability
            is just a more limited way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts
            or procedural macros can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases
            backporting the security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0
            are available in the wg-security-response repository for people building
            their own toolchain. We recommend users of alternate registries to excercise
            care in which package they download, by only including trusted dependencies
            in their projects. Please note that even with these vulnerabilities fixed,
            by design Cargo allows arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to
            build scripts and procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able
            to cause damage regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io implemented
            server-side checks to reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there
            are no packages on crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io
            users still need to excercise care in choosing their dependencies though,
            as the same concerns about build scripts and procedural macros apply here.'

        summary: graphql-java before19.0 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. An attacker

            versions are 19.0 and later, 18.3, and 17.4, and 0.0.0-2022-07-26T05-45-04-226aabd9.
    CVE-2022-31006:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-31006
        summary: indy-node is the server portion of Hyperledger Indy, a distributed
            ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In vulnerable versions
            of indy-node, an attacker can max out the number of client connections
            allowed by the ledger, leaving the ledger unable to be used for its intended
            purpose. However, the ledger content will not be impacted and the ledger
            will resume functioning after the attack. This attack exploits the trade-off
            between resilience and availability. Any protection against abusive client
            connections will also prevent the network being accessed by certain legitimate
            users. As a result, validator nodes must tune their firewall rules to
            ensure the right trade-off for their network's expected users. The guidance
            to network operators for the use of firewall rules in the deployment of
            Indy networks has been modified to better protect against denial of service
            attacks by increasing the cost and complexity in mounting such attacks.
            The mitigation for this vulnerability is not in the Hyperledger Indy code
            per se, but rather in the individual deployments of Indy. The mitigations
            should be applied to all deployments of Indy, and are not related to a
            particular release.

            the in-memory sizes of concurrently uploaded JPEG images, which allows

    CVE-2022-36083:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-36083
        summary: 'JOSE is "JSON Web Almost Everything" - JWA, JWS, JWE, JWT, JWK,
            JWKS with no dependencies using runtime''s native crypto in Node.js, Browser,
            Cloudflare Workers, Electron, and Deno. The PBKDF2-based JWE key management
            algorithms expect a JOSE Header Parameter named `p2c` PBES2 Count, which
            determines how many PBKDF2 iterations must be executed in order to derive
            a CEK wrapping key. The purpose of this parameter is to intentionally
            slow down the key derivation function in order to make password brute-force
            and dictionary attacks more expensive. This makes the PBES2 algorithms
            unsuitable for situations where the JWE is coming from an untrusted source:
            an adversary can intentionally pick an extremely high PBES2 Count value,
            that will initiate a CPU-bound computation that may take an unreasonable
            amount of time to finish. Under certain conditions, it is possible to
            have the user''s environment consume unreasonable amount of CPU time.
            The impact is limited only to users utilizing the JWE decryption APIs
            with symmetric secrets to decrypt JWEs from untrusted parties who do not
            limit the accepted JWE Key Management Algorithms (`alg` Header Parameter)
            using the `keyManagementAlgorithms` (or `algorithms` in v1.x) decryption
            option or through other means. The `v1.28.2`, `v2.0.6`, `v3.20.4`, and
            `v4.9.2` releases limit the maximum PBKDF2 iteration count to `10000`
            by default. It is possible to adjust this limit with a newly introduced
            `maxPBES2Count` decryption option. If users are unable to upgrade their
            required library version, they have two options depending on whether they
            expect to receive JWEs using any of the three PBKDF2-based JWE key management
            algorithms. They can use the `keyManagementAlgorithms` decryption option
            to disable accepting PBKDF2 altogether, or they can inspect the JOSE Header
            prior to using the decryption API and limit the PBKDF2 iteration count
            (`p2c` Header Parameter).'
    CVE-2022-35913:

        summary: Samourai Wallet Stonewallx2 0.99.98e allows a denial of service via
            a P2P coinjoin. The attacker and victim must follow each other's paynym.
            Then, the victim must try to collaborate with the attacker for a Stonewallx2
            transaction. Next, the attacker broadcasts a tx, spending the inputs used
            in Stonewallx2 before the victim can broadcast the collaborative transaction.
            The attacker does not signal opt in RBF, and uses the lowest fee rate.
            This would result in the victim being unable to perform Stonewallx2. (Note
            that the attacker could use multiple paynyms.)
    CVE-2022-36064:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-36064
        summary: Shescape is a shell escape package for JavaScript. An Inefficient
            Regular Expression Complexity vulnerability impacts users that use Shescape
            to escape arguments for the Unix shells `Bash` and `Dash`, or any not-officially-supported
            Unix shell; and/or using the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions with the
            `interpolation` option set to `true`. An attacker can cause polynomial
            backtracking or quadratic runtime in terms of the input string length
            due to two Regular Expressions in Shescape that are vulnerable to Regular
            Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). This bug has been patched in v1.5.10.
            For `Dash` only, this bug has been patched since v1.5.9. As a workaround,
            a maximum length can be enforced on input strings to Shescape to reduce
            the impact of the vulnerability. It is not recommended to try and detect
            vulnerable input strings, as the logic for this may end up being vulnerable
            to ReDoS itself.

    CVE-2022-2053:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-2053
        summary: When a POST request comes through AJP and the request exceeds the
            max-post-size limit (maxEntitySize), Undertow's AjpServerRequestConduit
            implementation closes a connection without sending any response to the
            client/proxy. This behavior results in that a front-end proxy marking
            the backend worker (application server) as an error state and not forward
            requests to the worker for a while. In mod_cluster, this continues until
            the next STATUS request (10 seconds intervals) from the application server
            updates the server state. So, in the worst case, it can result in "All
            workers are in error state" and mod_cluster responds "503 Service Unavailable"
            for a while (up to 10 seconds). In mod_proxy_balancer, it does not forward
            requests to the worker until the "retry" timeout passes. However, luckily,
            mod_proxy_balancer has "forcerecovery" setting (On by default; this parameter
            can force the immediate recovery of all workers without considering the
            retry parameter of the workers if all workers of a balancer are in error
            state.). So, unlike mod_cluster, mod_proxy_balancer does not result in
            responding "503 Service Unavailable". An attacker could use this behavior
            to send a malicious request and trigger server errors, resulting in DoS
            (denial of service). This flaw was fixed in Undertow 2.2.19.Final, Undertow
            2.3.0.Alpha2.

    CVE-2022-35922:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-35922
        summary: Rust-WebSocket is a WebSocket (RFC6455) library written in Rust.
            In versions prior to 0.26.5 untrusted websocket connections can cause
            an out-of-memory (OOM) process abort in a client or a server. The root
            cause of the issue is during dataframe parsing. Affected versions would
            allocate a buffer based on the declared dataframe size, which may come
            from an untrusted source. When `Vec::with_capacity` fails to allocate,
            the default Rust allocator will abort the current process, killing all
            threads. This affects only sync (non-Tokio) implementation. Async version
            also does not limit memory, but does not use `with_capacity`, so DoS can
            happen only when bytes for oversized dataframe or message actually got
            delivered by the attacker. The crashes are fixed in version 0.26.5 by
            imposing default dataframe size limits. Affected users are advised to
            update to this version. Users unable to upgrade are advised to filter
            websocket traffic externally or to only accept trusted traffic.

    CVE-2021-43854:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-43854
        summary: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a suite of open source Python
            modules, data sets, and tutorials supporting research and development
            in Natural Language Processing. Versions prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable
            to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. The vulnerability
            is present in PunktSentenceTokenizer, sent_tokenize and word_tokenize.
            Any users of this class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to the
            ReDoS attack. In short, a specifically crafted long input to any of these
            vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant amount of execution
            time. If your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizing
            unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to
            a version of NLTK without the vulnerability. For users unable to upgrade
            the execution time can be bounded by limiting the maximum length of an
            input to any of the vulnerable functions. Our recommendation is to implement
            such a limit.

            and the built-in i18n support. Deployments on Vercel, along with similar
            environments where invalid requests are filtered before reaching Next.js,
            are not affected. A patch has been released, `next@12.0.9`, that mitigates
            this issue. As a workaround, one may ensure `/${locale}/_next/` is blocked
            from reaching the Next.js instance until it becomes feasible to upgrade.

        summary: graphql-go is a GraphQL server with a focus on ease of use. In versions
            prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is possible due to
            a bug in the library that would allow an attacker with specifically designed
            queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user with access to the GraphQL
            handler can send these queries and cause stack overflows. This in turn
            could potentially compromise the ability of the server to serve data to
            its users. The issue has been patched in version `v1.3.0`. The only known
            workaround for this issue is to disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option

            a login to the so-modified account.
    CVE-2022-24902:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-24902
        summary: TkVideoplayer is a simple library to play video files in tkinter.
            Uncontrolled memory consumption in versions of TKVideoplayer prior to
            2.0.0 can theoretically lead to performance degradation. There are no
            known workarounds. This issue has been patched and users are advised to
            upgrade to version 2.0.0 or later.
    CVE-2022-29167:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-29167
        summary: Hawk is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making
            authenticated HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of
            the request and response, covering the HTTP method, request URI, host,
            and optionally the request payload. Hawk used a regular expression to
            parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject
            to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the
            attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially. `parseHost()`
            was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to parse hostname instead.
            `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options` argument. If that contains `host`
            and `port`, those would be used instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.

    CVE-2002-20001:
        cve_id: CVE-2002-20001
        summary: The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows remote attackers
            (from the client side) to send arbitrary numbers that are actually not
            public keys, and trigger expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation
            calculations, aka a D(HE)ater attack. The client needs very little CPU
            resources and network bandwidth. The attack may be more disruptive in
            cases where a client can require a server to select its largest supported
            key size. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that
            it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to
            allow DHE.
    CVE-2021-43173:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-43173
        summary: In NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2, a validation run can be
            delayed significantly by an RRDP repository by not answering but slowly
            drip-feeding bytes to keep the connection alive. This can be used to effectively
            stall validation. While Routinator has a configurable time-out value for
            RRDP connections, this time-out was only applied to individual read or
            write operations rather than the complete request. Thus, if an RRDP repository
            sends a little bit of data before that time-out expired, it can continuously
            extend the time it takes for the request to finish. Since validation will
            only continue once the update of an RRDP repository has concluded, this
            delay will cause validation to stall, leading to Routinator continuing
            to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly
            after starting, never serve any data at all.

        summary: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior
            to 1.22.1 secompressors accumulate decompressed data into an intermediate
            buffer before overwriting the body in the decode/encodeBody. This may
            allow an attacker to zip bomb the decompressor by sending a small highly
            compressed payload. Maliciously constructed zip files may exhaust system
            memory and cause a denial of service. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
            unable to upgrade may consider disabling decompression.
    CVE-2022-31030:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-31030
        summary: containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in
            the containerd's CRI implementation where programs inside a container
            can cause the containerd daemon to consume memory without bound during
            invocation of the `ExecSync` API. This can cause containerd to consume
            all available memory on the computer, denying service to other legitimate
            workloads. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's
            CRI implementation; `ExecSync` may be used when running probes or when
            executing processes via an "exec" facility. This bug has been fixed in
            containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13. Users should update to these versions to
            resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted
            images and commands are used.
    CVE-2022-1708:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-1708
        summary: A vulnerability was found in CRI-O that causes memory or disk space
            exhaustion on the node for anyone with access to the Kube API. The ExecSync
            request runs commands in a container and logs the output of the command.
            This output is then read by CRI-O after command execution, and it is read
            in a manner where the entire file corresponding to the output of the command
            is read in. Thus, if the output of the command is large it is possible
            to exhaust the memory or the disk space of the node when CRI-O reads the
            output of the command. The highest threat from this vulnerability is system
            availability.

            RELEASE.2019-09-25T18-25-51Z and ending with version RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z,
            MinIO is vulnerable to an unending go-routine buildup while keeping connections
            established due to HTTP clients not closing the connections. Public-facing
            MinIO deployments are most affected. Users should upgrade to RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z
            to receive a patch. One possible workaround is to use a reverse proxy
            to limit the number of connections being attempted in front of MinIO,
            and actively rejecting connections from such malicious clients.

        summary: Hyperledger Besu is an open-source, MainNet compatible, Ethereum
            client written in Java. In Besu before version 1.5.1 there is a denial-of-service
            vulnerability involving the HTTP JSON-RPC API service. If username and
            password authentication is enabled for the HTTP JSON-RPC API service,
            then prior to making any requests to an API endpoint the requestor must
            use the login endpoint to obtain a JSON web token (JWT) using their credentials.
            A single user can readily overload the login endpoint with invalid requests
            (incorrect password). As the supplied password is checked for validity
            on the main vertx event loop and takes a relatively long time this can
            cause the processing of other valid requests to fail. A valid username
            is required for this vulnerability to be exposed. This has been fixed

    CVE-2022-21698:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-21698
        summary: client_golang is the instrumentation library for Go applications
            in Prometheus, and the promhttp package in client_golang provides tooling
            around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to version 1.11.1,
            HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through unbounded cardinality,
            and potential memory exhaustion, when handling requests with non-standard
            HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an instrumented software must use
            any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*` middleware except `RequestsInFlight`;
            not filter any specific methods (e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric
            with `method` label name to our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy
            that filters away requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version
            1.11.1 contains a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available,
            including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in
            the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding
            custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request
            method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application
            firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.

    CVE-2021-21271:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-21271
        summary: "Tendermint Core is an open source Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)\
            \ middleware that takes a state transition machine - written in any programming\
            \ language - and securely replicates it on many machines. Tendermint Core\
            \ v0.34.0 introduced a new way of handling evidence of misbehavior. As\
            \ part of this, we added a new Timestamp field to Evidence structs. This\
            \ timestamp would be calculated using the same algorithm that is used\
            \ when a block is created and proposed. (This algorithm relies on the\
            \ timestamp of the last commit from this specific block.) In Tendermint\
            \ Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2, the consensus reactor is responsible for forming\
            \ DuplicateVoteEvidence whenever double signs are observed. However, the\
            \ current block is still \u201Cin flight\u201D when it is being formed\
            \ by the consensus reactor. It hasn\u2019t been finalized through network\
            \ consensus yet. This means that different nodes in the network may observe\
            \ different \u201Clast commits\u201D when assigning a timestamp to DuplicateVoteEvidence.\
            \ In turn, different nodes could form DuplicateVoteEvidence objects at\
            \ the same height but with different timestamps. One DuplicateVoteEvidence\
            \ object (with one timestamp) will then eventually get finalized in the\
            \ block, but this means that any DuplicateVoteEvidence with a different\
            \ timestamp is considered invalid. Any node that formed invalid DuplicateVoteEvidence\
            \ will continue to propose invalid evidence; its peers may see this, and\
            \ choose to disconnect from this node. This bug means that double signs\
            \ are DoS vectors in Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2. Tendermint Core\
            \ v0.34.3 is a security release which fixes this bug. As of v0.34.3, DuplicateVoteEvidence\
            \ is no longer formed by the consensus reactor; rather, the consensus\
            \ reactor passes the Votes themselves into the EvidencePool, which is\
            \ now responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence. The EvidencePool\
            \ has timestamp info that should be consistent across the network, which\
            \ means that DuplicateVoteEvidence formed in this reactor should have\
            \ consistent timestamps. This release changes the API between the consensus\
            \ and evidence reactors."

        summary: The Snappy frame decoder function doesn't restrict the chunk length
            which may lead to excessive memory usage. Beside this it also may buffer
            reserved skippable chunks until the whole chunk was received which may
            lead to excessive memory usage as well. This vulnerability can be triggered
            by supplying malicious input that decompresses to a very big size (via
            a network stream or a file) or by sending a huge skippable chunk.

    CVE-2021-41115:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-41115
        summary: Zulip is an open source team chat server. In affected versions Zulip
            allows organization administrators on a server to configure "linkifiers"
            that automatically create links from messages that users send, detected
            via arbitrary regular expressions. Malicious organization administrators
            could subject the server to a denial-of-service via regular expression
            complexity attacks; most simply, by configuring a quadratic-time regular
            expression in a linkifier, and sending messages that exploited it. A regular
            expression attempted to parse the user-provided regexes to verify that
            they were safe from ReDoS -- this was both insufficient, as well as _itself_
            subject to ReDoS if the organization administrator entered a sufficiently
            complex invalid regex. Affected users should [upgrade to the just-released
            Zulip 4.7](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release),

    CVE-2021-32617:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-32617
        summary: Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
            deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An inefficient algorithm
            (quadratic complexity) was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier.
            The inefficient algorithm is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata
            into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability
            to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running
            Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4. Note
            that this bug is only triggered when _writing_ the metadata, which is
            a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than _reading_ the metadata. For
            example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you
            need to add an extra command-line argument such as `rm`.

    CVE-2021-29509:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-29509
        summary: Puma is a concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications.
            The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected
            existing connections that had already been accepted from having their
            requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads
            in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by
            greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes
            in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive`
            connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service
            only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections.
            This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests
            false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without
            a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself
            to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git
            patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.

    CVE-2021-21419:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-21419
        summary: Eventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python. A websocket
            peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending very large websocket
            frames. Malicious peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending
            highly compressed data frame. A patch in version 0.31.0 restricts websocket
            frame to reasonable limits. As a workaround, restricting memory usage
            via OS limits would help against overall machine exhaustion, but there
            is no workaround to protect Eventlet process.

        summary: Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP.
            Synapse is a reference "homeserver" implementation of Matrix. A malicious
            or poorly-implemented homeserver can inject malformed events into a room
            by specifying a different room id in the path of a `/send_join`, `/send_leave`,
            `/invite` or `/exchange_third_party_invite` request. This can lead to
            a denial of service in which future events will not be correctly sent
            to other servers over federation. This affects any server which accepts
            federation requests from untrusted servers. The Matrix Synapse reference
            implementation before version 1.23.1 the implementation is vulnerable
            to this injection attack. Issue is fixed in version 1.23.1. As a workaround

    CVE-2020-3533:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-3533
        summary: A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
            input packet processor of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
            could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device
            to restart unexpectedly. The vulnerability is due to a lack of sufficient
            memory management protections under heavy SNMP polling loads. An attacker
            could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of SNMP requests
            to the SNMP daemon through the management interface on an affected device.
            A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNMP daemon
            process to consume a large amount of system memory over time, which could
            then lead to an unexpected device restart, causing a denial of service
            (DoS) condition. This vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP.
    CVE-2020-3529:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-3529
        summary: A vulnerability in the SSL VPN negotiation process for Cisco Adaptive
            Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD)
            Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload
            of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
            The vulnerability is due to inefficient direct memory access (DMA) memory
            management during the negotiation phase of an SSL VPN connection. An attacker
            could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of crafted
            Datagram TLS (DTLS) traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit
            could allow the attacker to exhaust DMA memory on the device and cause
            a DoS condition.

    CVE-2019-19922:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-19922
        summary: kernel/sched/fair.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.9, when cpu.cfs_quota_us
            is used (e.g., with Kubernetes), allows attackers to cause a denial of
            service against non-cpu-bound applications by generating a workload that
            triggers unwanted slice expiration, aka CID-de53fd7aedb1. (In other words,
            although this slice expiration would typically be seen with benign workloads,
            it is possible that an attacker could calculate how many stray requests
            are required to force an entire Kubernetes cluster into a low-performance
            state caused by slice expiration, and ensure that a DDoS attack sent that
            number of stray requests. An attack does not affect the stability of the
            kernel; it only causes mismanagement of application execution.)

        summary: The _encode_invalid_chars function in util/url.py in the urllib3
            library 1.25.2 through 1.25.7 for Python allows a denial of service (CPU
            consumption) because of an inefficient algorithm. The percent_encodings
            array contains all matches of percent encodings. It is not deduplicated.
            For a URL of length N, the size of percent_encodings may be up to O(N).
            The next step (normalize existing percent-encoded bytes) also takes up
            to O(N) for each step, so the total time is O(N^2). If percent_encodings
            were deduplicated, the time to compute _encode_invalid_chars would be
            O(kN), where k is at most 484 ((10+6*2)^2).

    CVE-2020-3190:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-3190
        summary: A vulnerability in the IPsec packet processor of Cisco IOS XR Software
            could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service
            (DoS) condition for IPsec sessions to an affected device. The vulnerability
            is due to improper handling of packets by the IPsec packet processor.
            An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious ICMP
            error messages to an affected device that get punted to the IPsec packet
            processor. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deplete IPsec
            memory, resulting in all future IPsec packets to an affected device being
            dropped by the device. Manual intervention is required to recover from
            this situation.

            Appliances (ESAs) could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to exhaust
            resources on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
            control over system memory allocation. An attacker could exploit this
            vulnerability by sending a crafted email through the targeted device.
            A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an email attachment
            that contains malware to be delivered to a user and cause email processing
            delays.
    CVE-2020-3175:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-3175
        summary: A vulnerability in the resource handling system of Cisco NX-OS Software
            for Cisco MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches could allow an unauthenticated,
            remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected
            device. The vulnerability is due to improper resource usage control. An
            attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic to the management
            interface (mgmt0) of an affected device at very high rates. An exploit
            could allow the attacker to cause unexpected behaviors such as high CPU
            usage, process crashes, or even full system reboots of an affected device.
    CVE-2019-6477:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-6477
        summary: With pipelining enabled each incoming query on a TCP connection requires
            a similar resource allocation to a query received via UDP or via TCP without
            pipelining enabled. A client using a TCP-pipelined connection to a server
            could consume more resources than the server has been provisioned to handle.
            When a TCP connection with a large number of pipelined queries is closed,
            the load on the server releasing these multiple resources can cause it
            to become unresponsive, even for queries that can be answered authoritatively
            or from cache. (This is most likely to be perceived as an intermittent
            server problem).

    CVE-2022-24726:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-24726
        summary: Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices.
            In affected versions the Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to
            a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a
            specially crafted message which results in the control plane crashing
            when the validating webhook for a cluster is exposed publicly. This endpoint
            is served over TLS port 15017, but does not require any authentication
            from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only
            reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However,
            for some deployments, especially [external istiod](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/external-controlplane/)
            topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. This issue
            has been patched in versions 1.13.2, 1.12.5 and 1.11.8. Users are advised
            to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable access to a validating
            webhook that is exposed to the public internet or restrict the set of
            IP addresses that can query it to a set of known, trusted entities.
    CVE-2021-3733:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-3733
        summary: There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class. An attacker
            who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client (such as web
            browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular Expression Denial of Service
            (ReDOS) during an authentication request with a specially crafted payload
            that is sent by the server to the client. The greatest threat that this
            flaw poses is to application availability.
    CVE-2022-24713:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-24713
        summary: regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust language.
            The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent denial of service
            attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted input matched by trusted
            regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already provide sane defaults to
            prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented and it's considered part
            of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was discovered in the mitigations
            designed to prevent untrusted regexes to take an arbitrary amount of time
            during parsing, and it's possible to craft regexes that bypass such mitigations.
            This makes it possible to perform denial of service attacks by sending
            specially crafted regexes to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted
            regexes. All versions of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are
            affected by this issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5.
            All users accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade
            immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately there
            is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically infinite
            regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability. Because of
            this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic regexes.

    CVE-2020-10995:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-10995
        summary: PowerDNS Recursor from 4.1.0 up to and including 4.3.0 does not sufficiently
            defend against amplification attacks. An issue in the DNS protocol has
            been found that allow malicious parties to use recursive DNS services
            to attack third party authoritative name servers. The attack uses a crafted
            reply by an authoritative name server to amplify the resulting traffic
            between the recursive and other authoritative name servers. Both types
            of service can suffer degraded performance as an effect. This is triggered
            by random subdomains in the NSDNAME in NS records. PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.16,
            4.2.2 and 4.3.1 contain a mitigation to limit the impact of this DNS protocol
            issue.
    CVE-2020-8616:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-8616
        summary: 'A malicious actor who intentionally exploits this lack of effective
            limitation on the number of fetches performed when processing referrals
            can, through the use of specially crafted referrals, cause a recursing
            server to issue a very large number of fetches in an attempt to process
            the referral. This has at least two potential effects: The performance
            of the recursing server can potentially be degraded by the additional
            work required to perform these fetches, and The attacker can exploit this
            behavior to use the recursing server as a reflector in a reflection attack
            with a high amplification factor.'

    CVE-2020-3334:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-3334
        summary: A vulnerability in the ARP packet processing of Cisco Adaptive Security
            Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
            for Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliances could allow an unauthenticated,
            adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in
            a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
            is due to incorrect processing of ARP packets received by the management
            interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
            by sending a series of unicast ARP packets in a short timeframe that would
            reach the management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit
            could allow the attacker to consume resources on an affected device, which
            would prevent the device from sending internal system keepalives and eventually
            cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
    CVE-2020-3306:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-3306
        summary: A vulnerability in the DHCP module of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance

            allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
            (DoS) condition on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect
            processing of certain DHCP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
            by sending a crafted DHCP packet to the affected device. A successful
            exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected
            device.
    CVE-2020-3305:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-3305
        summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of the Border Gateway Protocol
            (BGP) module in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco
            Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
            remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability
            is due to incorrect processing of certain BGP packets. An attacker could
            exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP packet. A successful
            exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected
            device.
    CVE-2020-3303:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-3303
        summary: A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) feature
            of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower
            Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
            to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due
            to improper management of system memory. An attacker could exploit this
            vulnerability by sending malicious IKEv1 traffic to an affected device.
            A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition
            on the affected device.
    CVE-2020-3255:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-3255
        summary: A vulnerability in the packet processing functionality of Cisco Firepower
            Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
            to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The
            vulnerability is due to inefficient memory management. An attacker could
            exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of IPv4 or IPv6 traffic
            through an affected device. This traffic would need to match a configured
            block action in an access control policy. An exploit could allow the attacker
            to cause a memory exhaustion condition on the affected device, which would
            result in a DoS for traffic transiting the device, as well as sluggish
            performance of the management interface. Once the flood is stopped, performance
            should return to previous states.
    CVE-2020-3254:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-3254
        summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP)
            inspection feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software
            and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
            remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected
            device. The vulnerabilities are due to inefficient memory management.
            An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted MGCP
            packets through an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker
            to cause memory exhaustion resulting in a restart of an affected device,
            causing a DoS condition for traffic traversing the device.
    CVE-2020-3196:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-3196
        summary: A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer
            Security (TLS) handler of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software
            and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated,
            remote attacker to exhaust memory resources on the affected device, leading
            to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper
            resource management for inbound SSL/TLS connections. An attacker could
            exploit this vulnerability by establishing multiple SSL/TLS connections
            with specific conditions to the affected device. A successful exploit
            could allow the attacker to exhaust the memory on the affected device,
            causing the device to stop accepting new SSL/TLS connections and resulting
            in a DoS condition for services on the device that process SSL/TLS traffic.
            Manual intervention is required to recover an affected device.

            NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause
            a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability
            is due to excessive use of system resources when the affected device is
            logging a drop action for received MODE_PRIVATE (Mode 7) NTP packets.
            An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by flooding the device with
            a steady stream of Mode 7 NTP packets. A successful exploit could allow
            the attacker to cause high CPU and memory usage on the affected device,
            which could cause internal system processes to restart or cause the affected
            device to unexpectedly reload. Note: The NTP feature is enabled by default.'

    CVE-2021-32740:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-32740
        summary: Addressable is an alternative implementation to the URI implementation
            that is part of Ruby's standard library. An uncontrolled resource consumption
            vulnerability exists after version 2.3.0 through version 2.7.0. Within
            the URI template implementation in Addressable, a maliciously crafted
            template may result in uncontrolled resource consumption, leading to denial
            of service when matched against a URI. In typical usage, templates would
            not normally be read from untrusted user input, but nonetheless, no previous
            security advisory for Addressable has cautioned against doing this. Users
            of the parsing capabilities in Addressable but not the URI template capabilities
            are unaffected. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.0. As a workaround,
            only create Template objects from trusted sources that have been validated
            not to produce catastrophic backtracking.

    CVE-2021-32723:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-32723
        summary: Prism is a syntax highlighting library. Some languages before 1.24.0
            are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). When Prism
            is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker can craft
            a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. This problem
            has been fixed in Prism v1.24. As a workaround, do not use ASCIIDoc or
            ERB to highlight untrusted text. Other languages are not affected and
            can be used to highlight untrusted text.

    CVE-2020-5236:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-5236
        summary: 'Waitress version 1.4.2 allows a DOS attack When waitress receives
            a header that contains invalid characters. When a header like "Bad-header:
            xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\x10" is received, it will cause the regular expression
            engine to catastrophically backtrack causing the process to use 100% CPU
            time and blocking any other interactions. This allows an attacker to send
            a single request with an invalid header and take the service offline.
            This issue was introduced in version 1.4.2 when the regular expression
            was updated to attempt to match the behaviour required by errata associated
            with RFC7230. The regular expression that is used to validate incoming

        summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Teams client for Windows could
            allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the client to crash,
            resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker needs a
            valid developer account to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability
            is due to insufficient input validation when processing received adaptive
            cards. The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an adaptive
            card with malicious content to an existing user of the Cisco Webex Teams
            client for Windows. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause
            the targeted user's client to crash continuously. This vulnerability was

        summary: Multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of Border Gateway
            Protocol (BGP) Ethernet VPN (EVPN) functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software
            could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
            (DoS) condition. The vulnerabilities are due to incorrect processing of
            BGP update messages that contain crafted EVPN attributes. An attacker
            could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending BGP EVPN update messages
            with malformed attributes to be processed by an affected system. A successful
            exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly,
            resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts
            incoming BGP traffic only from explicitly defined peers. To exploit these
            vulnerabilities, the malicious BGP update message would need to come from
            a configured, valid BGP peer, or would need to be injected by the attacker
            into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to
            a BGP peer.

        summary: 'A vulnerability in the DHCPv6 feature of the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series
            Fabric Switches in Application-Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Mode could
            allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to run low
            on system memory, which could result in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition
            on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper memory management
            when DHCPv6 packets are received on an interface of the targeted device.
            An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number
            of malicious DHCPv6 packets to be processed by an affected device. A successful
            exploit could allow the attacker to cause the system to run low on memory,
            which could cause an eventual reboot of an affected device. The vulnerability
            only applies to IPv6 protocol packets and not for IPv4 protocol packets.
            This vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in
            ACI Mode running software version 13.0(1k). The vulnerability can only
            be exploited when unicast routing is enabled on the Bridge Domain (BD).
            DHCP and DHCP relay do not have to be configured for the vulnerability
            to be exploited. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg38918.'

        summary: A vulnerability in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access
            Points (CAPWAP) protocol implementation of Cisco Aironet and Catalyst
            9100 Access Points (APs) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker
            to cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial
            of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper resource
            management during CAPWAP message processing. An attacker could exploit
            this vulnerability by sending a high volume of legitimate wireless management
            frames within a short time to an affected device. A successful exploit
            could allow the attacker to cause a device to restart unexpectedly, resulting
            in a DoS condition for clients associated with the AP.

            stays below a maximum limit. The implementation in versions 1.10.0 through
            1.11.1 for HTTP/1.x traffic and all versions of Envoy for HTTP/2 traffic
            had O(n^2) performance characteristics. A remote attacker may craft a
            request that stays below the maximum request header size but consists
            of many thousands of small headers to consume CPU and result in a denial-of-service
            attack.

        summary: A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) feature
            of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower
            Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
            to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service
            (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper management of system
            memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious
            IKEv1 traffic to an affected device. The attacker does not need valid
            credentials to authenticate the VPN session, nor does the attacker's source
            address need to match a peer statement in the crypto map applied to the
            ingress interface of the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker
            to exhaust system memory resources, leading to a reload of an affected
            device.

    CVE-2018-16949:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-16949
        summary: An issue was discovered in OpenAFS before 1.6.23 and 1.8.x before
            1.8.2. Several data types used as RPC input variables were implemented
            as unbounded array types, limited only by the inherent 32-bit length field
            to 4 GB. An unauthenticated attacker could send, or claim to send, large
            input values and consume server resources waiting for those inputs, denying
            service to other valid connections.
    CVE-2018-1114:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-1114
        summary: It was found that URLResource.getLastModified() in Undertow closes
            the file descriptors only when they are finalized which can cause file
            descriptors to exhaust. This leads to a file handler leak.
    CVE-2016-7068:
        cve_id: CVE-2016-7068
        summary: An issue has been found in PowerDNS before 3.4.11 and 4.0.2, and
            PowerDNS recursor before 3.7.4 and 4.0.4, allowing a remote, unauthenticated
            attacker to cause an abnormal CPU usage load on the PowerDNS server by
            sending crafted DNS queries, which might result in a partial denial of
            service if the system becomes overloaded. This issue is based on the fact
            that the PowerDNS server parses all records present in a query regardless
            of whether they are needed or even legitimate. A specially crafted query
            containing a large number of records can be used to take advantage of
            that behaviour.
    CVE-2016-7072:
        cve_id: CVE-2016-7072
        summary: An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server before 3.4.11
            and 4.0.2 allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial
            of service by opening a large number of TCP connections to the web server.
            If the web server runs out of file descriptors, it triggers an exception
            and terminates the whole PowerDNS process. While it's more complicated
            for an unauthorized attacker to make the web server run out of file descriptors
            since its connection will be closed just after being accepted, it might
            still be possible.
    CVE-2016-9040:
        cve_id: CVE-2016-9040
        summary: An exploitable denial of service exists in the the Joyent SmartOS
            OS 20161110T013148Z Hyprlofs file system. The vulnerability is present
            in the Ioctl system call with the command HYPRLOFSADDENTRIES when used
            with a 32 bit model. An attacker can cause a buffer to be allocated and
            never freed. When repeatedly exploit this will result in memory exhaustion,
            resulting in a full system denial of service.

    CVE-2018-15470:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-15470
        summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x. The logic in oxenstored
            for handling writes depended on the order of evaluation of expressions
            making up a tuple. As indicated in section 7.7.3 "Operations on data structures"
            of the OCaml manual, the order of evaluation of subexpressions is not
            specified. In practice, different implementations behave differently.
            Thus, oxenstored may not enforce the configured quota-maxentity. This
            allows a malicious or buggy guest to write as many xenstore entries as
            it wishes, causing unbounded memory usage in oxenstored. This can lead
            to a system-wide DoS.

            vulnerability is to system availability.
    CVE-2020-15565:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-15565
        summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing x86 Intel
            HVM guest OS users to cause a host OS denial of service or possibly gain
            privileges because of insufficient cache write-back under VT-d. When page
            tables are shared between IOMMU and CPU, changes to them require flushing
            of both TLBs. Furthermore, IOMMUs may be non-coherent, and hence prior
            to flushing IOMMU TLBs, a CPU cache also needs writing back to memory
            after changes were made. Such writing back of cached data was missing
            in particular when splitting large page mappings into smaller granularity
            ones. A malicious guest may be able to retain read/write DMA access to
            frames returned to Xen's free pool, and later reused for another purpose.
            Host crashes (leading to a Denial of Service) and privilege escalation
            cannot be ruled out. Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are affected.
            Only x86 Intel systems are affected. x86 AMD as well as Arm systems are
            not affected. Only x86 HVM guests using hardware assisted paging (HAP),
            having a passed through PCI device assigned, and having page table sharing
            enabled can leverage the vulnerability. Note that page table sharing will
            be enabled (by default) only if Xen considers IOMMU and CPU large page
            size support compatible.

    CVE-2017-1000411:
        cve_id: CVE-2017-1000411
        summary: OpenFlow Plugin and OpenDayLight Controller versions Nitrogen, Carbon,
            Boron, Robert Varga, Anil Vishnoi contain a flaw when multiple 'expired'
            flows take up the memory resource of CONFIG DATASTORE which leads to CONTROLLER
            shutdown. If multiple different flows with 'idle-timeout' and 'hard-timeout'
            are sent to the Openflow Plugin REST API, the expired flows will eventually
            crash the controller once its resource allocations set with the JVM size
            are exceeded. Although the installed flows (with timeout set) are removed
            from network (and thus also from controller's operations DS), the expired
            entries are still present in CONFIG DS. The attack can originate both
            from NORTH or SOUTH. The above description is for a north bound attack.
            A south bound attack can originate when an attacker attempts a flow flooding
            attack and since flows come with timeouts, the attack is not successful.
            However, the attacker will now be successful in CONTROLLER overflow attack
            (resource consumption). Although, the network (actual flow tables) and
            operational DS are only (~)1% occupied, the controller requests for resource
            consumption. This happens because the installed flows get removed from
            the network upon timeout.

            (deadlock) via unspecified vectors.
    CVE-2017-5650:
        cve_id: CVE-2017-5650
        summary: In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.12, the handling
            of an HTTP/2 GOAWAY frame for a connection did not close streams associated
            with that connection that were currently waiting for a WINDOW_UPDATE before
            allowing the application to write more data. These waiting streams each
            consumed a thread. A malicious client could therefore construct a series
            of HTTP/2 requests that would consume all available processing threads.

            to 6.2.2. There is an Improper OCSP Validation Vulnerability. OCSP responses
            have two time values: thisUpdate and nextUpdate. These specify a validity
            period; however, both values are optional. Crypto-J treats the lack of
            a nextUpdate as indicating that the OCSP response is valid indefinitely
            instead of restricting its validity for a brief period surrounding the
            thisUpdate time. This vulnerability is similar to the issue described

    CVE-2020-26070:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-26070
        summary: A vulnerability in the ingress packet processing function of Cisco
            IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers
            could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
            (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper
            resource allocation when an affected device processes network traffic
            in software switching mode (punted). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
            by sending specific streams of Layer 2 or Layer 3 protocol data units
            (PDUs) to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause the affected
            device to run out of buffer resources, which could make the device unable
            to process or forward traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. The device
            would need to be restarted to regain functionality.
    CVE-2020-28327:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-28327
        summary: A res_pjsip_session crash was discovered in Asterisk Open Source
            13.x before 13.37.1, 16.x before 16.14.1, 17.x before 17.8.1, and 18.x
            before 18.0.1. and Certified Asterisk before 16.8-cert5. Upon receiving
            a new SIP Invite, Asterisk did not return the created dialog locked or
            referenced. This caused a gap between the creation of the dialog object,
            and its next use by the thread that created it. Depending on some off-nominal
            circumstances and timing, it was possible for another thread to free said
            dialog in this gap. Asterisk could then crash when the dialog object,
            or any of its dependent objects, were dereferenced or accessed next by
            the initial-creation thread. Note, however, that this crash can only occur
            when using a connection-oriented protocol (e.g., TCP or TLS, but not UDP)
            for SIP transport. Also, the remote client must be authenticated, or Asterisk
            must be configured for anonymous calling.
    CVE-2020-3555:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-3555
        summary: A vulnerability in the SIP inspection process of Cisco Adaptive Security
            Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
            could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a crash and reload
            of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
            The vulnerability is due to a watchdog timeout and crash during the cleanup
            of threads that are associated with a SIP connection that is being deleted
            from the connection list. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
            by sending a high rate of crafted SIP traffic through an affected device.
            A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a watchdog timeout
            and crash, resulting in a crash and reload of the affected device.

            from a shell command injection. A malicious user can abuse this vulnerability
            to obtain shell access to the Docker container running dovecot. The imapsync

    CVE-2023-24816:
        cve_id: CVE-2023-24816
        summary: IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing
            in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python
            programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject to a command
            injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites. This vulnerability
            requires that the function `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be
            called on Windows in a Python environment where ctypes is not available.
            The dependency on `ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents
            the vulnerable code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However,
            as a library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could
            be called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get
            untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to
            inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of the
            current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to upgrade.
            Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the `IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title`
            function are done with trusted or filtered input.

        summary: In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in
            CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c_rehash script does not
            properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were
            found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered
            that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates
            being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell.
            This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where
            it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could
            execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the
            c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL
            rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3).
            Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1o). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zf

            for yarn localization, which does enable remote code execution. It is
            used in Apache Spark, from the SQL command ADD ARCHIVE. As the ADD ARCHIVE
            command adds new binaries to the classpath, being able to execute shell
            scripts does not confer new permissions to the caller. SPARK-38305. "Check

            commands on affected installations of D-Link DIR-2150 4.0.1 routers. Authentication
            is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists
            within the Dreambox plugin for the xupnpd service, which listens on TCP
            port 4044 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation
            of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An
            attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context
            of the router. Was ZDI-CAN-15935.

        summary: Azure CLI is the command-line interface for Microsoft Azure. In versions
            previous to 2.40.0, Azure CLI contains a vulnerability for potential code
            injection. Critical scenarios are where a hosting machine runs an Azure
            CLI command where parameter values have been provided by an external source.
            The vulnerability is only applicable when the Azure CLI command is run
            on a Windows machine and with any version of PowerShell and when the parameter
            value contains the `&` or `|` symbols. If any of these prerequisites are
            not met, this vulnerability is not applicable. Users should upgrade to
            version 2.40.0 or greater to receive a a mitigation for the vulnerability.
    CVE-2022-39321:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-39321
        summary: GitHub Actions Runner is the application that runs a job from a GitHub
            Actions workflow. The actions runner invokes the docker cli directly in
            order to run job containers, service containers, or container actions.
            A bug in the logic for how the environment is encoded into these docker
            commands was discovered in versions prior to 2.296.2, 2.293.1, 2.289.4,
            2.285.2, and 2.283.4 that allows an input to escape the environment variable
            and modify that docker command invocation directly. Jobs that use container
            actions, job containers, or service containers alongside untrusted user
            inputs in environment variables may be vulnerable. The Actions Runner
            has been patched, both on `github.com` and hotfixes for GHES and GHAE
            customers in versions 2.296.2, 2.293.1, 2.289.4, 2.285.2, and 2.283.4.
            GHES and GHAE customers may want to patch their instance in order to have
            their runners automatically upgrade to these new runner versions. As a
            workaround, users may consider removing any container actions, job containers,
            or service containers from their jobs until they are able to upgrade their
            runner versions.

            an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected
            device or cause the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial
            of service (DoS) condition. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient
            validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could
            exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted request to the web-based
            management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
            execute arbitrary commands on an affected device with root-level privileges
            or to cause the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.
            To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid
            Administrator credentials on the affected device. Cisco has not released
            software updates that address these vulnerabilities.

        cve_id: CVE-2022-24725
        summary: Shescape is a shell escape package for JavaScript. An issue in versions
            1.4.0 to 1.5.1 allows for exposure of the home directory on Unix systems
            when using Bash with the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions from the _shescape_
            API with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. Other tested shells,
            Dash and Zsh, are not affected. Depending on how the output of _shescape_
            is used, directory traversal may be possible in the application using
            _shescape_. The issue was patched in version 1.5.1. As a workaround, manually
            escape all instances of the tilde character (`~`) using `arg.replace(/~/g,
            "\\~")`.

        summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application
            Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an authenticated, local
            attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device. This vulnerability
            is due to insufficient restrictions during the execution of a specific
            CLI command. An attacker with administrative privileges could exploit
            this vulnerability by performing a command injection attack on the vulnerable

        summary: BinderHub is a kubernetes-based cloud service that allows users to
            share reproducible interactive computing environments from code repositories.
            In affected versions a remote code execution vulnerability has been identified
            in BinderHub, where providing BinderHub with maliciously crafted input
            could execute code in the BinderHub context, with the potential to egress
            credentials of the BinderHub deployment, including JupyterHub API tokens,
            kubernetes service accounts, and docker registry credentials. This may
            provide the ability to manipulate images and other user created pods in
            the deployment, with the potential to escalate to the host depending on
            the underlying kubernetes configuration. Users are advised to update to
            version 0.2.0-n653. If users are unable to update they may disable the
            git repo provider by specifying the `BinderHub.repo_providers` as a workaround.

    CVE-2021-32751:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-32751
        summary: Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation. In versions
            prior to 7.2, start scripts generated by the `application` plugin and
            the `gradlew` script are both vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when
            an attacker is able to change environment variables for the user running
            the script. This may impact those who use `gradlew` on Unix-like systems
            or use the scripts generated by Gradle in thieir application on Unix-like
            systems. For this vulnerability to be exploitable, an attacker needs to
            be able to set the value of particular environment variables and have
            those environment variables be seen by the vulnerable scripts. This issue
            has been patched in Gradle 7.2 by removing the use of `eval` and requiring
            the use of the `bash` shell. There are a few workarounds available. For
            CI/CD systems using the Gradle build tool, one may ensure that untrusted
            users are unable to change environment variables for the user that executes
            `gradlew`. If one is unable to upgrade to Gradle 7.2, one may generate
            a new `gradlew` script with Gradle 7.2 and use it for older versions of
            Gradle. Fpplications using start scripts generated by Gradle, one may
            ensure that untrusted users are unable to change environment variables
            for the user that executes the start script. A vulnerable start script
            could be manually patched to remove the use of `eval` or the use of environment
            variables that affect the application's command-line. If the application
            is simple enough, one may be able to avoid the use of the start scripts
            by running the application directly with Java command.

    CVE-2022-21668:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-21668
        summary: pipenv is a Python development workflow tool. Starting with version
            2018.10.9 and prior to version 2022.1.8, a flaw in pipenv's parsing of
            requirements files allows an attacker to insert a specially crafted string
            inside a comment anywhere within a requirements.txt file, which will cause
            victims who use pipenv to install the requirements file to download dependencies
            from a package index server controlled by the attacker. By embedding malicious
            code in packages served from their malicious index server, the attacker
            can trigger arbitrary remote code execution (RCE) on the victims' systems.
            If an attacker is able to hide a malicious `--index-url` option in a requirements
            file that a victim installs with pipenv, the attacker can embed arbitrary
            malicious code in packages served from their malicious index server that
            will be executed on the victim's host during installation (remote code
            execution/RCE). When pip installs from a source distribution, any code
            in the setup.py is executed by the install process. This issue is patched
            in version 2022.1.8. The GitHub Security Advisory contains more information

    CVE-2021-27256:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-27256
        summary: This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary
            code on affected installations of NETGEAR R7800 firmware version 1.0.2.76.
            Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the
            existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists
            within the handling of the rc_service parameter provided to apply_save.cgi.
            The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied
            string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage
            this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-12355.

    CVE-2021-1452:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-1452
        summary: A vulnerability in the ROM Monitor (ROMMON) of Cisco IOS XE Software
            for Cisco Catalyst IE3200, IE3300, and IE3400 Rugged Series Switches,
            Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Heavy Duty Series Switches, and Cisco Embedded Services
            3300 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, physical attacker
            to execute unsigned code at system boot time. This vulnerability is due
            to incorrect validations of specific function arguments passed to a boot
            script when specific ROMMON variables are set. An attacker could exploit
            this vulnerability by setting malicious values for a specific ROMMON variable.
            A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute unsigned code
            and bypass the image verification check during the secure boot process
            of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would
            need to have unauthenticated, physical access to the device or obtain
            privileged access to the root shell on the device.
    CVE-2021-1443:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-1443
        summary: A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow
            an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root
            privileges on the underlying operating system of an affected device. The
            vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly sanitizes
            values that are parsed from a specific configuration file. An attacker
            could exploit this vulnerability by tampering with a specific configuration
            file and then sending an API call. A successful exploit could allow the
            attacker to inject arbitrary code that would be executed on the underlying
            operating system of the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability,
            the attacker would need to have a privileged set of credentials to the
            device.
    CVE-2021-1441:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-1441
        summary: A vulnerability in the hardware initialization routines of Cisco
            IOS XE Software for Cisco 1100 Series Industrial Integrated Services Routers
            and Cisco ESR6300 Embedded Series Routers could allow an authenticated,
            local attacker to execute unsigned code at system boot time. This vulnerability
            is due to incorrect validations of parameters passed to a diagnostic script
            that is executed when the device boots up. An attacker could exploit this
            vulnerability by tampering with an executable file stored on a device.
            A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute unsigned code
            at boot time and bypass the software image verification check part of
            the secure boot process of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability,
            the attacker would need administrative level credentials (level 15) on
            the device.
    CVE-2021-1384:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-1384
        summary: A vulnerability in Cisco IOx application hosting environment of Cisco
            IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject
            commands into the underlying operating system as the root user. This vulnerability
            is due to incomplete validation of fields in the application packages
            loaded onto IOx. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating
            a crafted application .tar file and loading it onto the device. A successful
            exploit could allow the attacker to perform command injection into the
            underlying operating system as the root user.
    CVE-2021-1382:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-1382
        summary: A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software could
            allow an authenticated, local attacker to inject arbitrary commands to
            be executed with root privileges on the underlying operating system. This
            vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation on certain CLI commands.
            An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the
            device and submitting crafted input to the CLI. The attacker must be authenticated
            as an administrative user to execute the affected commands. A successful
            exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root privileges.
    CVE-2021-21345:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-21345

    CVE-2020-15123:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-15123
        summary: In codecov (npm package) before version 3.7.1 the upload method has
            a command injection vulnerability. Clients of the codecov-node library
            are unlikely to be aware of this, so they might unwittingly write code
            that contains a vulnerability. A similar CVE (CVE-2020-7597 for GHSA-5q88-cjfq-g2mh)
            was issued but the fix was incomplete. It only blocked &, and command
            injection is still possible using backticks instead to bypass the sanitizer.
            The attack surface is low in this case. Particularly in the standard use
            of codecov, where the module is used directly in a build pipeline, not
            built against as a library in another application that may supply malicious
            input and perform command injection.

        summary: A vulnerability in the CLI parsers of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco
            809 and 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs) and
            Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers (CGR1000) could allow an authenticated,
            local attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the Virtual Device
            Server (VDS) of an affected device. The attacker must have valid user
            credentials at privilege level 15. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
            validation of arguments that are passed to specific VDS-related CLI commands.
            An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the
            targeted device and including malicious input as the argument of an affected
            command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
            commands in the context of the Linux shell of VDS with the privileges
            of the root user.
    CVE-2020-3207:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-3207
        summary: A vulnerability in the processing of boot options of specific Cisco
            IOS XE Software switches could allow an authenticated, local attacker
            with root shell access to the underlying operating system (OS) to conduct
            a command injection attack during device boot. This vulnerability is due
            to insufficient input validation checks while processing boot options.
            An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying device boot
            options to execute attacker-provided code. A successful exploit may allow
            an attacker to bypass the Secure Boot process and execute malicious code
            on an affected device with root-level privileges.
    CVE-2020-3205:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-3205
        summary: A vulnerability in the implementation of the inter-VM channel of
            Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial Integrated Services
            Routers (Industrial ISRs) and Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers
            (CGR1000) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute
            arbitrary shell commands on the Virtual Device Server (VDS) of an affected
            device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of signaling
            packets that are destined to VDS. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
            by sending malicious packets to an affected device. A successful exploit
            could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the context
            of the Linux shell of VDS with the privileges of the root user. Because
            the device is designed on a hypervisor architecture, exploitation of a
            vulnerability that affects the inter-VM channel may lead to a complete
            system compromise. For more information about this vulnerability, see
            the Details section of this advisory.

            version 1.0.1, an attacker can execute arbitrary (*) shell commands if
            they can control the value of [the `tag` input] or manage to alter the
            value of [the `GITHUB_REF` environment variable]. The problem has been
            patched in version 1.0.1. If you don't use the `tag` input you are most
            likely safe. The `GITHUB_REF` environment variable is protected by the
            GitHub Actions environment so attacks from there should be impossible.

    CVE-2019-9859:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-9859
        summary: 'Vesta Control Panel (VestaCP) 0.9.7 through 0.9.8-23 is vulnerable
            to an authenticated command execution that can result in remote root access
            on the server. The platform works with PHP as the frontend language and
            uses shell scripts to execute system actions. PHP executes shell script
            through the dangerous command exec. This function can be dangerous if
            arguments passed to it are not filtered. Every user input in VestaCP that
            is used as an argument is filtered with the escapeshellarg function. This
            function comes from the PHP library directly and its description is as
            follows: "escapeshellarg() adds single quotes around a string and quotes/escapes
            any existing single quotes allowing you to pass a string directly to a
            shell function and having it be treated as a single safe argument." It
            means that if you give Username, it will have ''Username'' as a replacement.
            This works well and protects users from exploiting this potentially dangerous
            exec function. Unfortunately, VestaCP uses this escapeshellarg function
            incorrectly in several places.'

    CVE-2020-9054:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-9054
        summary: 'Multiple ZyXEL network-attached storage (NAS) devices running firmware
            version 5.21 contain a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability,
            which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary
            code on a vulnerable device. ZyXEL NAS devices achieve authentication
            by using the weblogin.cgi CGI executable. This program fails to properly
            sanitize the username parameter that is passed to it. If the username
            parameter contains certain characters, it can allow command injection
            with the privileges of the web server that runs on the ZyXEL device. Although
            the web server does not run as the root user, ZyXEL devices include a
            setuid utility that can be leveraged to run any command with root privileges.
            As such, it should be assumed that exploitation of this vulnerability
            can lead to remote code execution with root privileges. By sending a specially-crafted
            HTTP POST or GET request to a vulnerable ZyXEL device, a remote, unauthenticated
            attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device. This may
            happen by directly connecting to a device if it is directly exposed to
            an attacker. However, there are ways to trigger such crafted requests
            even if an attacker does not have direct connectivity to a vulnerable
            devices. For example, simply visiting a website can result in the compromise
            of any ZyXEL device that is reachable from the client system. Affected
            products include: NAS326 before firmware V5.21(AAZF.7)C0 NAS520 before
            firmware V5.21(AASZ.3)C0 NAS540 before firmware V5.21(AATB.4)C0 NAS542

        summary: A vulnerability in Cisco Remote PHY Device Software could allow an
            authenticated, local attacker to execute commands on the underlying Linux
            shell of an affected device with root privileges. The vulnerability exists
            because the affected software does not properly sanitize user-supplied
            input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device
            could exploit this vulnerability by supplying certain CLI commands with
            crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run
            arbitrary commands as the root user, which could result in a complete
            system compromise.

    CVE-2020-26284:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-26284
        summary: Hugo is a fast and Flexible Static Site Generator built in Go. Hugo
            depends on Go's `os/exec` for certain features, e.g. for rendering of
            Pandoc documents if these binaries are found in the system `%PATH%` on
            Windows. In Hugo before version 0.79.1, if a malicious file with the same
            name (`exe` or `bat`) is found in the current working directory at the
            time of running `hugo`, the malicious command will be invoked instead
            of the system one. Windows users who run `hugo` inside untrusted Hugo
            sites are affected. Users should upgrade to Hugo v0.79.1. Other than avoiding
            untrusted Hugo sites, there is no workaround.

        summary: An issue was discovered in SolarWinds N-Central 12.3.0.670. The sudo
            configuration has incorrect access control because the nable web user
            account is effectively able to run arbitrary OS commands as root (i.e.,
            the use of root privileges is not limited to specific programs listed
            in the sudoers file).
    CVE-2020-35476:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-35476
        summary: A remote code execution vulnerability occurs in OpenTSDB through
            2.4.0 via command injection in the yrange parameter. The yrange value
            is written to a gnuplot file in the /tmp directory. This file is then
            executed via the mygnuplot.sh shell script. (tsd/GraphHandler.java attempted

    CVE-2020-26259:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-26259
        summary: XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again.
            In XStream before version 1.4.15, is vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Deletion
            on the local host when unmarshalling. The vulnerability may allow a remote
            attacker to delete arbitrary know files on the host as log as the executing
            process has sufficient rights only by manipulating the processed input
            stream. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework,
            you will have to use at least version 1.4.15. The reported vulnerability
            does not exist running Java 15 or higher. No user is affected, who followed
            the recommendation to setup XStream's Security Framework with a whitelist!
            Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklist can immediately switch to
            a whilelist for the allowed types to avoid the vulnerability. Users of
            XStream 1.4.14 or below who still want to use XStream default blacklist
            can use a workaround described in more detailed in the referenced advisories.

    CVE-2020-8429:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-8429
        summary: The Admin web application in Kinetica 7.0.9.2.20191118151947 does
            not properly sanitise the input for the function getLogs. This lack of
            sanitisation could be exploited to allow an authenticated attacker to
            run remote code on the underlying operating system. The logFile parameter
            in the getLogs function was used as a variable in a command to read log
            files; however, due to poor input sanitisation, it was possible to bypass
            a replacement and break out of the command.
    CVE-2013-0517:

    CVE-2019-14514:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-14514
        summary: An issue was discovered in Microvirt MEmu all versions prior to 7.0.2.
            A guest Android operating system inside the MEmu emulator contains a /system/bin/systemd
            binary that is run with root privileges on startup (this is unrelated
            to Red Hat's systemd init program, and is a closed-source proprietary
            tool that seems to be developed by Microvirt). This program opens TCP
            port 21509, presumably to receive installation-related commands from the
            host OS. Because everything after the installer:uninstall command is concatenated
            directly into a system() call, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands
            by supplying shell metacharacters.
    CVE-2013-4267:

    CVE-2019-18424:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-18424
        summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing attackers
            to gain host OS privileges via DMA in a situation where an untrusted domain
            has access to a physical device. This occurs because passed through PCI
            devices may corrupt host memory after deassignment. When a PCI device
            is assigned to an untrusted domain, it is possible for that domain to
            program the device to DMA to an arbitrary address. The IOMMU is used to
            protect the host from malicious DMA by making sure that the device addresses
            can only target memory assigned to the guest. However, when the guest
            domain is torn down, or the device is deassigned, the device is assigned
            back to dom0, thus allowing any in-flight DMA to potentially target critical
            host data. An untrusted domain with access to a physical device can DMA
            into host memory, leading to privilege escalation. Only systems where
            guests are given direct access to physical devices capable of DMA (PCI
            pass-through) are vulnerable. Systems which do not use PCI pass-through
            are not vulnerable.
    CVE-2019-14931:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-14931
        summary: An issue was discovered on Mitsubishi Electric ME-RTU devices through
            2.02 and INEA ME-RTU devices through 3.0. An unauthenticated remote OS
            Command Injection vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary
            commands on the RTU due to the passing of unsafe user supplied data to
            the RTU's system shell. Functionality in mobile.php provides users with
            the ability to ping sites or IP addresses via Mobile Connection Test.
            When the Mobile Connection Test is submitted, action.php is called to
            execute the test. An attacker can use a shell command separator (;) in
            the host variable to execute operating system commands upon submitting
            the test data.

        cve_id: CVE-2019-1829
        summary: A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Aironet Series Access Points
            (APs) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain access to the
            underlying Linux operating system (OS) without the proper authentication.
            The attacker would need valid administrator device credentials. The vulnerability
            is due to improper validation of user-supplied input for certain CLI commands.
            An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected
            device and submitting crafted input for a CLI command. A successful exploit
            could allow the attacker to obtain access to the underlying Linux OS without

            Center (FMC), or through Cisco FMC on other Firepower sensors and devices
            that are controlled by the same Cisco FMC. To send the commands, the attacker
            must have root privileges for at least one affected sensor or the Cisco
            FMC. The vulnerability exists because the affected software performs insufficient
            checks for certain CLI commands, if the commands are executed via a Sourcefire
            tunnel connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating
            with root privileges to a Firepower sensor or Cisco FMC, and then sending
            specific CLI commands to the Cisco FMC or through the Cisco FMC to another
            Firepower sensor via the Sourcefire tunnel connection. A successful exploit

        summary: A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE M875 (All versions).
            An authenticated remote attacker with access to the web interface (443/tcp),
            could execute arbitrary operating system commands. Successful exploitation
            requires that the attacker has network access to the web interface. The
            attacker must be authenticated as administrative user to exploit the security
            vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
            code on the device. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation
            of this security vulnerability was known.

            of an affected device and escalate their privileges to the root user.
    CVE-2018-17707:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-17707
        summary: This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
            on vulnerable installations of Epic Games Launcher versions prior to 8.2.2.
            User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
            target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific
            flaw exists within the handler for the com.epicgames.launcher protocol.
            A crafted URI with the com.epicgames.launcher protocol can trigger execution
            of a system call composed from a user-supplied string. An attacker can
            leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current
            user. Was ZDI-CAN-7241.
    CVE-2019-1636:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-1636
        summary: A vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Teams client, formerly Cisco Spark,
            could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a targeted system.
            This vulnerability is due to unsafe search paths used by the application
            URI that is defined in Windows operating systems. An attacker could exploit
            this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user to follow a malicious
            link. Successful exploitation could cause the application to load libraries
            from the directory targeted by the URI link. The attacker could use this
            behavior to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges
            of the targeted user if the attacker can place a crafted library in a
            directory that is accessible to the vulnerable system.

    CVE-2018-15442:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-15442
        summary: A vulnerability in the update service of Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop
            App for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute
            arbitrary commands as a privileged user. The vulnerability is due to insufficient
            validation of user-supplied parameters. An attacker could exploit this
            vulnerability by invoking the update service command with a crafted argument.
            An exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands with SYSTEM
            user privileges. While the CVSS Attack Vector metric denotes the requirement
            for an attacker to have local access, administrators should be aware that
            in Active Directory deployments, the vulnerability could be exploited
            remotely by leveraging the operating system remote management tools.

    CVE-2018-3955:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-3955
        summary: An exploitable operating system command injection exists in the Linksys
            ESeries line of routers (Linksys E1200 Firmware Version 2.0.09 and Linksys
            E2500 Firmware Version 3.0.04). Specially crafted entries to network configuration
            information can cause execution of arbitrary system commands, resulting
            in full control of the device. An attacker can send an authenticated HTTP
            request to trigger this vulnerability. Data entered into the 'Domain Name'
            input field through the web portal is submitted to apply.cgi as the value
            to the 'wan_domain' POST parameter. The wan_domain data goes through the
            nvram_set process described above. When the 'preinit' binary receives
            the SIGHUP signal it enters a code path that calls a function named 'set_host_domain_name'
            from its libshared.so shared object.

            Version 2.0.09 and Linksys E2500 Firmware Version 3.0.04) are susceptible
            to OS command injection vulnerabilities due to improper filtering of data
            passed to and retrieved from NVRAM. Data entered into the 'Router Name'
            input field through the web portal is submitted to apply.cgi as the value
            to the 'machine_name' POST parameter. When the 'preinit' binary receives
            the SIGHUP signal, it enters a code path that continues until it reaches
            offset 0x0042B5C4 in the 'start_lltd' function. Within the 'start_lltd'
            function, a 'nvram_get' call is used to obtain the value of the user-controlled
            'machine_name' NVRAM entry. This value is then entered directly into a
            command intended to write the host name to a file and subsequently executed.

        summary: A Command Injection issue was discovered in ContentStore/Base/CVDataPipe.dll
            in Commvault before v11 SP6. A certain message parsing function inside
            the Commvault service does not properly validate the input of an incoming
            string before passing it to CreateProcess. As a result, a specially crafted
            message can inject commands that will be executed on the target operating
            system. Exploitation of this vulnerability does not require authentication
            and can lead to SYSTEM level privilege on any system running the cvd daemon.

        summary: An issue was discovered in Trend Micro InterScan Messaging Security
            (Virtual Appliance) 9.1-1600. An authenticated user can execute a terminal
            command in the context of the web server user (which is root). Besides,
            the default installation of IMSVA comes with default administrator credentials.
            The saveCert.imss endpoint takes several user inputs and performs blacklisting.
            After that, it uses them as arguments to a predefined operating-system
            command without proper sanitization. However, because of an improper blacklisting
            rule, it's possible to inject arbitrary commands into it.

    CVE-2016-10043:
        cve_id: CVE-2016-10043
        summary: An issue was discovered in Radisys MRF Web Panel (SWMS) 9.0.1. The
            MSM_MACRO_NAME POST parameter in /swms/ms.cgi was discovered to be vulnerable
            to OS command injection attacks. It is possible to use the pipe character
            (|) to inject arbitrary OS commands and retrieve the output in the application's
            responses. Attackers could execute unauthorized commands, which could
            then be used to disable the software, or read, write, and modify data
            for which the attacker does not have permissions to access directly. Since
            the targeted application is directly executing the commands instead of
            the attacker, any malicious activities may appear to come from the application
            or the application's owner (apache user).

    CVE-2019-12511:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-12511
        summary: 'In NETGEAR Nighthawk X10-R9000 prior to 1.0.4.26, an attacker may
            execute arbitrary system commands as root by sending a specially-crafted
            MAC address to the "NETGEAR Genie" SOAP endpoint at AdvancedQoS:GetCurrentBandwidthByMAC.
            Although this requires QoS being enabled, advanced QoS being enabled,
            and a valid authentication JWT, additional vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-12510)
            allow an attacker to interact with the entire SOAP API without authentication.
            Additionally, DNS rebinding techniques may be used to exploit this vulnerability
            remotely. Exploiting this vulnerability is somewhat involved. The following
            limitations apply to the payload and must be overcome for successful exploitation:
            - No more than 17 characters may be used. - At least one colon must be
            included to prevent mangling. - A single-quote and meta-character must
            be used to break out of the existing command. - Parent command remnants
            after the injection point must be dealt with. - The payload must be in
            all-caps. Despite these limitations, it is still possible to gain access
            to an interactive root shell via this vulnerability. Since the web server
            assigns certain HTTP headers to environment variables with all-caps names,
            it is possible to insert a payload into one such header and reference
            the subsequent environment variable in the injection point.'

    CVE-2022-42722:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-42722
        summary: In the Linux kernel 5.8 through 5.19.x before 5.19.16, local attackers
            able to inject WLAN frames into the mac80211 stack could cause a NULL
            pointer dereference denial-of-service attack against the beacon protection
            of P2P devices.
    CVE-2022-3358:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-3358
        summary: OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy EVP_CIPHER_meth_new()
            function and associated function calls. This function was deprecated in
            OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the
            new provider mechanism in order to implement custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions
            3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the
            EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() and EVP_CipherInit_ex2()
            functions (as well as other similarly named encryption and decryption
            initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly
            it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available
            providers. An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new().
            This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However
            it is possible for an application to incorrectly pass NID_undef as this
            value in the call to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When NID_undef is used in
            this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will
            match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the
            available providers. This will succeed if the default provider has been
            loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers this
            cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as
            the ciphertext. Applications are only affected by this issue if they call
            EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using NID_undef and subsequently use it in a call
            to an encryption/decryption initialisation function. Applications that
            only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.6
            (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.5).
    CVE-2022-31681:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-31681
        summary: VMware ESXi contains a null-pointer deference vulnerability. A malicious
            actor with privileges within the VMX process only, may create a denial
            of service condition on the host.
    CVE-2022-2928:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-2928
        summary: In ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.3, ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16-P1,
            when the function option_code_hash_lookup() is called from add_option(),
            it increases the option's refcount field. However, there is not a corresponding
            call to option_dereference() to decrement the refcount field. The function
            add_option() is only used in server responses to lease query packets.
            Each lease query response calls this function for several options, so
            eventually, the reference counters could overflow and cause the server
            to abort.

    CVE-2023-0401:
        cve_id: CVE-2023-0401
        summary: A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified
            on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash algorithm
            used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but the implementation
            of the hash algorithm is not available the digest initialization will
            fail. There is a missing check for the return value from the initialization
            function which later leads to invalid usage of the digest API most likely
            leading to a crash. The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by
            using FIPS enabled configuration of providers or more commonly by not
            loading the legacy provider. PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library
            calls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation
            in OpenSSL does not call these functions however third party applications
            would be affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on
            untrusted data.
    CVE-2023-0217:
        cve_id: CVE-2023-0217
        summary: An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application
            tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the EVP_PKEY_public_check()
            function. This will most likely lead to an application crash. This function
            can be called on public keys supplied from untrusted sources which could
            allow an attacker to cause a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation
            in OpenSSL does not call this function but applications might call the
            function if there are additional security requirements imposed by standards
            such as FIPS 140-3.

    CVE-2022-41972:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-41972
        summary: 'Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for
            Next-Generation IoT devices. Versions prior to 4.9 contain a NULL Pointer
            Dereference in BLE L2CAP module. The Contiki-NG operating system for IoT
            devices contains a Bluetooth Low Energy stack. An attacker can inject
            a packet in this stack, which causes the implementation to dereference
            a NULL pointer and triggers undefined behavior. More specifically, while
            processing the L2CAP protocol, the implementation maps an incoming channel
            ID to its metadata structure. In this structure, state information regarding
            credits is managed through calls to the function input_l2cap_credit in
            the module os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c. Unfortunately, the input_l2cap_credit
            function does not check that the metadata corresponding to the user-supplied
            channel ID actually exists, which can lead to the channel variable being
            set to NULL before a pointer dereferencing operation is performed. The
            vulnerability has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG,
            and will be included in release 4.9. Users can apply the patch in Contiki-NG
            pull request #2253 as a workaround until the new package is released.'

    CVE-2023-31129:
        cve_id: CVE-2023-31129
        summary: 'The Contiki-NG operating system versions 4.8 and prior can be triggered
            to dereference a NULL pointer in the message handling code for IPv6 router
            solicitiations. Contiki-NG contains an implementation of IPv6 Neighbor
            Discovery (ND) in the module `os/net/ipv6/uip-nd6.c`. The ND protocol
            includes a message type called Router Solicitation (RS), which is used
            to locate routers and update their address information via the SLLAO (Source
            Link-Layer Address Option). If the indicated source address changes, a
            given neighbor entry is set to the STALE state.


            The message handler does not check for RS messages with an SLLAO that
            indicates a link-layer address change that a neighbor entry can actually
            be created for the indicated address. The resulting pointer is used without
            a check, leading to the dereference of a NULL pointer of type `uip_ds6_nbr_t`.


            The problem has been patched in the `develop` branch of Contiki-NG, and
            will be included in the upcoming 4.9 release. As a workaround, users can
            apply Contiki-NG pull request #2271 to patch the problem directly.'

            17.9.3, and 18.x before 18.2.2, and Certified Asterisk before 16.8-cert7,
            allows an attacker to trigger a crash by sending an m=image line and zero
            port in a response to a T.38 re-invite initiated by Asterisk. This is
            a re-occurrence of the CVE-2019-15297 symptoms but not for exactly the
            same reason. The crash occurs because there is an append operation relative
            to the active topology, but this should instead be a replace operation.
    CVE-2022-39028:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-39028
        summary: 'telnetd in GNU Inetutils through 2.3, MIT krb5-appl through 1.0.3,
            and derivative works has a NULL pointer dereference via 0xff 0xf7 or 0xff
            0xf8. In a typical installation, the telnetd application would crash but
            the telnet service would remain available through inetd. However, if the
            telnetd application has many crashes within a short time interval, the
            telnet service would become unavailable after inetd logs a "telnet/tcp
            server failing (looping), service terminated" error. NOTE: MIT krb5-appl
            is not supported upstream but is shipped by a few Linux distributions.
            The affected code was removed from the supported MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5)
            product many years ago, at version 1.8.'

    CVE-2022-23526:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-23526
        summary: Helm is a tool for managing Charts, pre-configured Kubernetes resources.
            Versions prior to 3.10.3 are subject to NULL Pointer Dereference in the_chartutil_
            package that can cause a segmentation violation. The _chartutil_ package
            contains a parser that loads a JSON Schema validation file. For example,
            the Helm client when rendering a chart will validate its values with the
            schema file. The _chartutil_ package parses the schema file and loads
            it into structures Go can work with. Some schema files can cause array
            data structures to be created causing a memory violation. Applications
            that use the _chartutil_ package in the Helm SDK to parse a schema file
            can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot
            be recovered from. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will
            not affect future uses of the Helm client. This issue has been patched
            in 3.10.3. SDK users can validate schema files that are correctly formatted
            before passing them to the _chartutil_ functions.
    CVE-2022-23525:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-23525
        summary: Helm is a tool for managing Charts, pre-configured Kubernetes resources.
            Versions prior to 3.10.3 are subject to NULL Pointer Dereference in the
            _repo_package. The _repo_ package contains a handler that processes the
            index file of a repository. For example, the Helm client adds references
            to chart repositories where charts are managed. The _repo_ package parses
            the index file of the repository and loads it into structures Go can work
            with. Some index files can cause array data structures to be created causing
            a memory violation. Applications that use the _repo_ package in the Helm
            SDK to parse an index file can suffer a Denial of Service when that input
            causes a panic that cannot be recovered from. The Helm Client will panic
            with an index file that causes a memory violation panic. Helm is not a
            long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm
            client. This issue has been patched in 3.10.3. SDK users can validate
            index files that are correctly formatted before passing them to the _repo_
            functions.

    CVE-2022-23476:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-23476
        summary: Nokogiri is an open source XML and HTML library for the Ruby programming
            language. Nokogiri `1.13.8` and `1.13.9` fail to check the return value
            from `xmlTextReaderExpand` in the method `Nokogiri::XML::Reader#attribute_hash`.
            This can lead to a null pointer exception when invalid markup is being
            parsed. For applications using `XML::Reader` to parse untrusted inputs,
            this may potentially be a vector for a denial of service attack. Users
            are advised to upgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.13.10`. Users may be able to
            search their code for calls to either `XML::Reader#attributes` or `XML::Reader#attribute_hash`
            to determine if they are affected.

    CVE-2022-2309:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-2309
        summary: NULL Pointer Dereference allows attackers to cause a denial of service
            (or application crash). This only applies when lxml is used together with
            libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not affected.
            It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable
            code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk
            function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't
            be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be
            replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter
            that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there
            are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is
            received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash
            can be triggered.

    CVE-2022-2085:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-2085
        summary: A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in Ghostscript,
            which occurs when it tries to render a large number of bits in memory.
            When allocating a buffer device, it relies on an init_device_procs defined
            for the device that uses it as a prototype that depends upon the number
            of bits per pixel. For bpp > 64, mem_x_device is used and does not have
            an init_device_procs defined. This flaw allows an attacker to parse a
            large number of bits (more than 64 bits per pixel), which triggers a NULL
            pointer dereference flaw, causing an application to crash.

    CVE-2022-29206:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-29206
        summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior
            to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorDenseAdd`
            does not fully validate the input arguments. In this case, a reference
            gets bound to a `nullptr` during kernel execution. This is undefined behavior.
            Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.
    CVE-2022-29205:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-29205
        summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior
            to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, there is a potential for segfault
            / denial of service in TensorFlow by calling `tf.compat.v1.*` ops which
            don't yet have support for quantized types, which was added after migration
            to TensorFlow 2.x. In these scenarios, since the kernel is missing, a
            `nullptr` value is passed to `ParseDimensionValue` for the `py_value`
            argument. Then, this is dereferenced, resulting in segfault. Versions
            2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.

    CVE-2022-23595:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-23595
        summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When building
            an XLA compilation cache, if default settings are used, TensorFlow triggers
            a null pointer dereference. In the default scenario, all devices are allowed,
            so `flr->config_proto` is `nullptr`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
            2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow
            2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported
            range.
    CVE-2022-23589:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-23589
        summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain
            scenarios, Grappler component of TensorFlow can trigger a null pointer
            dereference. There are 2 places where this can occur, for the same malicious
            alteration of a `SavedModel` file (fixing the first one would trigger
            the same dereference in the second place). First, during constant folding,
            the `GraphDef` might not have the required nodes for the binary operation.
            If a node is missing, the correposning `mul_*child` would be null, and
            the dereference in the subsequent line would be incorrect. We have a similar
            issue during `IsIdentityConsumingSwitch`. The fix will be included in
            TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1,
            TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and
            still in supported range.

            of `GetInitOp` is vulnerable to a crash caused by dereferencing a null
            pointer. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick

    CVE-2022-23570:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-23570
        summary: Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When decoding
            a tensor from protobuf, TensorFlow might do a null-dereference if attributes
            of some mutable arguments to some operations are missing from the proto.
            This is guarded by a `DCHECK`. However, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production
            builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution
            proceeds to the dereferencing of the null pointer, whereas in the second
            case it results in a crash due to the assertion failure. The fix will
            be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
            TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and

    CVE-2021-34737:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-34737
        summary: 'A vulnerability in the DHCP version 4 (DHCPv4) server feature of
            Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
            to trigger a crash of the dhcpd process, resulting in a denial of service
            (DoS) condition. This vulnerability exists because certain DHCPv4 messages
            are improperly validated when they are processed by an affected device.
            An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed DHCPv4
            message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
            to cause a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a crash of the dhcpd
            process. While the dhcpd process is restarting, which may take up to approximately
            two minutes, DHCPv4 server services are unavailable on the affected device.
            This could temporarily prevent network access to clients that join the
            network during that time period. Note: Only the dhcpd process crashes
            and eventually restarts automatically. The router does not reload.'

            In affected versions the implementation of SVDF in TFLite is [vulnerable
            to a null pointer error](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/lite/kernels/svdf.cc#L300-L313).
            The [`GetVariableInput` function](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/lite/kernels/kernel_util.cc#L115-L119)
            can return a null pointer but `GetTensorData` assumes that the argument
            is always a valid tensor. Furthermore, because `GetVariableInput` calls
            [`GetMutableInput`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/lite/kernels/kernel_util.cc#L82-L90)
            which might return `nullptr`, the `tensor->is_variable` expression can
            also trigger a null pointer exception. We have patched the issue in GitHub
            commit 5b048e87e4e55990dae6b547add4dae59f4e1c76. The fix will be included
            in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
            2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected
            and still in supported range.
    CVE-2021-37648:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-37648
        summary: 'TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
            In affected versions the code for `tf.raw_ops.SaveV2` does not properly
            validate the inputs and an attacker can trigger a null pointer dereference.
            The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/save_restore_v2_ops.cc)
            uses `ValidateInputs` to check that the input arguments are valid. This
            validation would have caught the illegal state represented by the reproducer
            above. However, the validation uses `OP_REQUIRES` which translates to
            setting the `Status` object of the current `OpKernelContext` to an error
            status, followed by an empty `return` statement which just terminates
            the execution of the function it is present in. However, this does not
            mean that the kernel execution is finalized: instead, execution continues
            from the next line in `Compute` that follows the call to `ValidateInputs`.
            This is equivalent to lacking the validation. We have patched the issue
            in GitHub commit 9728c60e136912a12d99ca56e106b7cce7af5986. The fix will
            be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on

        summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
            In affected versions an attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding
            a reference to null pointer in all binary cwise operations that don't
            require broadcasting (e.g., gradients of binary cwise operations). The
            [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/cwise_ops_common.h#L264)
            assumes that the two inputs have exactly the same number of elements but
            does not check that. Hence, when the eigen functor executes it triggers
            heap OOB reads and undefined behavior due to binding to nullptr. We have
            patched the issue in GitHub commit 93f428fd1768df147171ed674fee1fc5ab8309ec.
            The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick

        cve_id: CVE-2021-37649
        summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
            The code for `tf.raw_ops.UncompressElement` can be made to trigger a null
            pointer dereference. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/experimental/compression_ops.cc#L50-L53)
            obtains a pointer to a `CompressedElement` from a `Variant` tensor and
            then proceeds to dereference it for decompressing. There is no check that
            the `Variant` tensor contained a `CompressedElement`, so the pointer is
            actually `nullptr`. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 7bdf50bb4f5c54a4997c379092888546c97c3ebd.
            The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick

    CVE-2021-37647:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-37647
        summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
            When a user does not supply arguments that determine a valid sparse tensor,
            `tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorSliceDataset` implementation can be made to dereference
            a null pointer. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/sparse_tensor_slice_dataset_op.cc#L240-L251)
            has some argument validation but fails to consider the case when either
            `indices` or `values` are provided for an empty sparse tensor when the
            other is not. If `indices` is empty, then [code that performs validation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/sparse_tensor_slice_dataset_op.cc#L260-L261)
            (i.e., checking that the indices are monotonically increasing) results
            in a null pointer dereference. If `indices` as provided by the user is
            empty, then `indices` in the C++ code above is backed by an empty `std::vector`,
            hence calling `indices->dim_size(0)` results in null pointer dereferencing
            (same as calling `std::vector::at()` on an empty vector). We have patched
            the issue in GitHub commit 02cc160e29d20631de3859c6653184e3f876b9d7. The
            fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this

        cve_id: CVE-2021-37643
        summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
            If a user does not provide a valid padding value to `tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagPartOp`,
            then the code triggers a null pointer dereference (if input is empty)
            or produces invalid behavior, ignoring all values after the first. The
            [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/matrix_diag_op.cc#L89)
            reads the first value from a tensor buffer without first checking that
            the tensor has values to read from. We have patched the issue in GitHub
            commit 482da92095c4d48f8784b1f00dda4f81c28d2988. The fix will be included

    CVE-2021-37639:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-37639
        summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
            When restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided,
            TensorFlow can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer. Alternatively,
            attackers can read memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by
            providing some tensor names but not enough for a successful restoration.
            The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/kernels/save_restore_tensor.cc#L158-L159)
            retrieves the tensor list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled
            input and immediately retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled
            via `preferred_shard` argument). This occurs without validating that the
            provided list has enough values. If the list is empty this results in
            dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior). If, however, the list
            has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the bounds this
            results in heap OOB read. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622.
            The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick

    CVE-2021-41208:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-41208
        summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
            versions the code for boosted trees in TensorFlow is still missing validation.
            As a result, attackers can trigger denial of service (via dereferencing
            `nullptr`s or via `CHECK`-failures) as well as abuse undefined behavior
            (binding references to `nullptr`s). An attacker can also read and write
            from heap buffers, depending on the API that gets used and the arguments
            that are passed to the call. Given that the boosted trees implementation
            in TensorFlow is unmaintained, it is recommend to no longer use these
            APIs. We will deprecate TensorFlow's boosted trees APIs in subsequent
            releases. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick
            this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4,
            as these are also affected and still in supported range.
    CVE-2021-41217:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-41217
        summary: TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected
            versions the process of building the control flow graph for a TensorFlow
            model is vulnerable to a null pointer exception when nodes that should
            be paired are not. This occurs because the code assumes that the first
            node in the pairing (e.g., an `Enter` node) always exists when encountering
            the second node (e.g., an `Exit` node). When this is not the case, `parent`
            is `nullptr` so dereferencing it causes a crash. The fix will be included
            in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
            2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected
            and still in supported range.

            assumes that the `serialize_sparse` tensor is a tensor with positive rank
            (and having `3` as the last dimension). The fix will be included in TensorFlow
            2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow
            2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported

    CVE-2022-24736:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-24736
        summary: Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Prior to versions
            6.2.7 and 7.0.0, an attacker attempting to load a specially crafted Lua
            script can cause NULL pointer dereference which will result with a crash
            of the redis-server process. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0
            and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching
            the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to
            block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.

            Incomplete validation in `SparseAdd` results in allowing attackers to
            exploit undefined behavior (dereferencing null pointers) as well as write
            outside of bounds of heap allocated data. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/656e7673b14acd7835dc778867f84916c6d1cac2/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_add_op.cc)
            has a large set of validation for the two sparse tensor inputs (6 tensors
            in total), but does not validate that the tensors are not empty or that
            the second dimension of `*_indices` matches the size of corresponding
            `*_shape`. This allows attackers to send tensor triples that represent
            invalid sparse tensors to abuse code assumptions that are not protected
            by validation. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also

        summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
            The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm` is vulnerable to a heap
            buffer overflow. If the tensors are empty, the same implementation can
            trigger undefined behavior by dereferencing null pointers. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/57d86e0db5d1365f19adcce848dfc1bf89fdd4c7/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc)
            fails to validate that `scale`, `offset`, `mean` and `variance` (the last
            two only when required) all have the same number of elements as the number
            of channels of `x`. This results in heap out of bounds reads when the
            buffers backing these tensors are indexed past their boundary. If the
            tensors are empty, the validation mentioned in the above paragraph would
            also trigger and prevent the undefined behavior. The fix will be included
            in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow

            `permutation` to `tf.raw_ops.SparseMatrixSparseCholesky`. This is because
            the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/080f1d9e257589f78b3ffb75debf584168aa6062/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse/sparse_cholesky_op.cc#L85-L86)
            fails to properly validate the input arguments. Although `ValidateInputs`
            is called and there are checks in the body of this function, the code
            proceeds to the next line in `ValidateInputs` since `OP_REQUIRES`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/080f1d9e257589f78b3ffb75debf584168aa6062/tensorflow/core/framework/op_requires.h#L41-L48)
            is a macro that only exits the current function. Thus, the first validation
            condition that fails in `ValidateInputs` will cause an early return from
            that function. However, the caller will continue execution from the next
            line. The fix is to either explicitly check `context->status()` or to
            convert `ValidateInputs` to return a `Status`. The fix will be included
            in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
            2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these
            are also affected and still in supported range.

        cve_id: CVE-2021-29518
        summary: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
            In eager mode (default in TF 2.0 and later), session operations are invalid.
            However, users could still call the raw ops associated with them and trigger
            a null pointer dereference. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/eebb96c2830d48597d055d247c0e9aebaea94cd5/tensorflow/core/kernels/session_ops.cc#L104)
            dereferences the session state pointer without checking if it is valid.
            Thus, in eager mode, `ctx->session_state()` is nullptr and the call of
            the member function is undefined behavior. The fix will be included in
            TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2,
            TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are

            Calling `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToVariant` with arguments specifying an
            invalid ragged tensor results in a null pointer dereference. The implementation
            of `RaggedTensorToVariant` operations(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/904b3926ed1c6c70380d5313d282d248a776baa1/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_variant_op.cc#L39-L40)
            does not validate that the ragged tensor argument is non-empty. Since
            `batched_ragged` contains no elements, `batched_ragged.splits` is a null
            vector, thus `batched_ragged.splits(0)` will result in dereferencing `nullptr`.

    CVE-2020-29484:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-29484
        summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. When a Xenstore watch
            fires, the xenstore client that registered the watch will receive a Xenstore
            message containing the path of the modified Xenstore entry that triggered
            the watch, and the tag that was specified when registering the watch.
            Any communication with xenstored is done via Xenstore messages, consisting
            of a message header and the payload. The payload length is limited to
            4096 bytes. Any request to xenstored resulting in a response with a payload
            longer than 4096 bytes will result in an error. When registering a watch,
            the payload length limit applies to the combined length of the watched
            path and the specified tag. Because watches for a specific path are also
            triggered for all nodes below that path, the payload of a watch event
            message can be longer than the payload needed to register the watch. A
            malicious guest that registers a watch using a very large tag (i.e., with
            a registration operation payload length close to the 4096 byte limit)
            can cause the generation of watch events with a payload length larger
            than 4096 bytes, by writing to Xenstore entries below the watched path.
            This will result in an error condition in xenstored. This error can result
            in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a crash of xenstored. A malicious
            guest administrator can cause xenstored to crash, leading to a denial
            of service. Following a xenstored crash, domains may continue to run,
            but management operations will be impossible. Only C xenstored is affected,
            oxenstored is not affected.
    CVE-2020-29571:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-29571
        summary: An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. A bounds check common
            to most operation time functions specific to FIFO event channels depends
            on the CPU observing consistent state. While the producer side uses appropriately
            ordered writes, the consumer side isn't protected against re-ordered reads,
            and may hence end up de-referencing a NULL pointer. Malicious or buggy
            guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the
            entire system. Only Arm systems may be vulnerable. Whether a system is
            vulnerable depends on the specific CPU. x86 systems are not vulnerable.

    CVE-2020-1971:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-1971
        summary: 'The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different
            types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL
            provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances
            of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves
            incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer
            dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service
            attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes:
            1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and
            a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying
            that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority
            name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token)
            If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker
            could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client
            or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL
            then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download
            CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior
            to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL''s
            s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the "-crl_download"
            option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has
            been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated
            bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct
            correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct
            a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL''s parser will accept and hence
            trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected
            by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not
            been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in

    CVE-2021-3449:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-3449
        summary: An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation
            ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello
            omits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the
            initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension
            then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a
            denial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2
            and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL
            TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions
            are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to
            OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in
            OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1j).

            code execution.
    CVE-2020-17525:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-17525
        summary: Subversion's mod_authz_svn module will crash if the server is using
            in-repository authz rules with the AuthzSVNReposRelativeAccessFile option
            and a client sends a request for a non-existing repository URL. This can
            lead to disruption for users of the service. This issue was fixed in mod_dav_svn+mod_authz_svn
            servers 1.14.1 and mod_dav_svn+mod_authz_svn servers 1.10.7
    CVE-2021-28543:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-28543
        summary: Varnish varnish-modules before 0.17.1 allows remote attackers to
            cause a denial of service (daemon restart) in some configurations. This
            does not affect organizations that only install the Varnish Cache product;
            however, it is common to install both Varnish Cache and varnish-modules.
            Specifically, an assertion failure or NULL pointer dereference can be
            triggered in Varnish Cache through the varnish-modules header.append()
            and header.copy() functions. For some Varnish Configuration Language (VCL)
            files, this gives remote clients an opportunity to cause a Varnish Cache
            restart. A restart reduces overall availability and performance due to
            an increased number of cache misses, and may cause higher load on backend
            servers.
    CVE-2021-25674:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-25674
        summary: A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC S7-PLCSIM V5.4 (All
            versions). An attacker with local access to the system could cause a Denial-of-Service
            condition in the application when it is used to open a specially crafted
            file. As a consequence, a NULL pointer deference condition could cause
            the application to terminate unexpectedly and must be restarted to restore
            the service.
    CVE-2021-28361:

    CVE-2021-23841:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-23841
        summary: The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts
            to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data
            contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle
            any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might
            occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently
            result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial
            of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never
            directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable
            if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that
            may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i
            and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade
            to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this
            issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving
            public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade
            to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j
            (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).
    CVE-2021-21702:

        summary: In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.27, 7.4.x below 7.4.15 and 8.0.x
            below 8.0.2, when using SOAP extension to connect to a SOAP server, a
            malicious SOAP server could return malformed XML data as a response that
            would cause PHP to access a null pointer and thus cause a crash.
    CVE-2020-25858:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-25858
        summary: The QCMAP_Web_CLIENT binary in the Qualcomm QCMAP software suite
            prior to versions released in October 2020 does not validate the return
            value of a strstr() or strchr() call in the Tokenizer() function. An attacker
            who invokes the web interface with a crafted URL can crash the process,
            causing denial of service. This version of QCMAP is used in many kinds
            of networking devices, primarily mobile hotspots and LTE routers.
    CVE-2020-9746:

    CVE-2020-15209:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-15209
        summary: In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and
            2.3.1, a crafted TFLite model can force a node to have as input a tensor
            backed by a `nullptr` buffer. This can be achieved by changing a buffer
            index in the flatbuffer serialization to convert a read-only tensor to
            a read-write one. The runtime assumes that these buffers are written to
            before a possible read, hence they are initialized with `nullptr`. However,
            by changing the buffer index for a tensor and implicitly converting that
            tensor to be a read-write one, as there is nothing in the model that writes
            to it, we get a null pointer dereference. The issue is patched in commit
            0b5662bc, and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2,
            2.2.1, or 2.3.1.
    CVE-2020-15204:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-15204
        summary: In eager mode, TensorFlow before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1
            and 2.3.1 does not set the session state. Hence, calling `tf.raw_ops.GetSessionHandle`
            or `tf.raw_ops.GetSessionHandleV2` results in a null pointer dereference
            In linked snippet, in eager mode, `ctx->session_state()` returns `nullptr`.
            Since code immediately dereferences this, we get a segmentation fault.
            The issue is patched in commit 9a133d73ae4b4664d22bd1aa6d654fec13c52ee1,
            and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or
            2.3.1.
    CVE-2020-15190:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-15190
        summary: In Tensorflow before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1,
            the `tf.raw_ops.Switch` operation takes as input a tensor and a boolean
            and outputs two tensors. Depending on the boolean value, one of the tensors
            is exactly the input tensor whereas the other one should be an empty tensor.
            However, the eager runtime traverses all tensors in the output. Since
            only one of the tensors is defined, the other one is `nullptr`, hence
            we are binding a reference to `nullptr`. This is undefined behavior and
            reported as an error if compiling with `-fsanitize=null`. In this case,
            this results in a segmentation fault The issue is patched in commit da8558533d925694483d2c136a9220d6d49d843c,
            and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or

    CVE-2020-3552:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-3552
        summary: A vulnerability in the Ethernet packet handling of Cisco Aironet
            Access Points (APs) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent
            attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.
            The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker
            could exploit this vulnerability by connecting as a wired client to the
            Ethernet interface of an affected device and sending a series of specific
            packets within a short time frame. A successful exploit could allow the
            attacker to cause a NULL pointer access that results in a reload of the
            affected device.
    CVE-2020-3407:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-3407
        summary: A vulnerability in the RESTCONF and NETCONF-YANG access control list
            (ACL) function of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated,
            remote attacker to cause the device to reload. The vulnerability is due
            to incorrect processing of the ACL that is tied to the RESTCONF or NETCONF-YANG
            feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the
            device using RESTCONF or NETCONF-YANG. A successful exploit could allow
            an attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service
            (DoS) condition.

    CVE-2020-10711:
        cve_id: CVE-2020-10711
        summary: A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SELinux
            subsystem in versions before 5.7. This flaw occurs while importing the
            Commercial IP Security Option (CIPSO) protocol's category bitmap into
            the SELinux extensible bitmap via the' ebitmap_netlbl_import' routine.
            While processing the CIPSO restricted bitmap tag in the 'cipso_v4_parsetag_rbm'
            routine, it sets the security attribute to indicate that the category
            bitmap is present, even if it has not been allocated. This issue leads
            to a NULL pointer dereference issue while importing the same category
            bitmap into SELinux. This flaw allows a remote network user to crash the
            system kernel, resulting in a denial of service.

    CVE-2021-31618:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-31618
        summary: Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks
            received request headers against the size limitations as configured for
            the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these
            restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code
            indicating why the request was rejected. This rejection response was not
            fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header
            was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to
            a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the
            child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft
            and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server. This issue affected

    CVE-2019-13590:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-13590
        summary: An issue was discovered in libsox.a in SoX 14.4.2. In sox-fmt.h (startread
            function), there is an integer overflow on the result of integer addition
            (wraparound to 0) fed into the lsx_calloc macro that wraps malloc. When
            a NULL pointer is returned, it is used without a prior check that it is
            a valid pointer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference on lsx_readbuf
            in formats_i.c.
    CVE-2019-13161:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-13161
        summary: An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source through 13.27.0,
            14.x and 15.x through 15.7.2, and 16.x through 16.4.0, and Certified Asterisk
            through 13.21-cert3. A pointer dereference in chan_sip while handling
            SDP negotiation allows an attacker to crash Asterisk when handling an
            SDP answer to an outgoing T.38 re-invite. To exploit this vulnerability
            an attacker must cause the chan_sip module to send a T.38 re-invite request
            to them. Upon receipt, the attacker must send an SDP answer containing
            both a T.38 UDPTL stream and another media stream containing only a codec
            (which is not permitted according to the chan_sip configuration).
    CVE-2019-13225:

            as common optional libraries for PHP and Rust.
    CVE-2019-1922:
        cve_id: CVE-2019-1922
        summary: A vulnerability in Cisco SIP IP Phone Software for Cisco IP Phone
            7800 Series and 8800 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
            to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected phone. The
            vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of input Session Initiation
            Protocol (SIP) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
            altering the SIP replies that are sent to the affected phone during the
            registration process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
            cause the phone to reboot and not complete the registration process.

            an exported NFS filesystem, is able to trigger a null pointer dereference
            by using an invalid NFS sequence. This can panic the machine and deny
            access to the NFS server. Any outstanding disk writes to the NFS server
            will be lost.

            denial of service.
    CVE-2018-16851:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-16851
        summary: Samba from version 4.0.0 and before versions 4.7.12, 4.8.7, 4.9.3
            is vulnerable to a denial of service. During the processing of an LDAP
            search before Samba's AD DC returns the LDAP entries to the client, the
            entries are cached in a single memory object with a maximum size of 256MB.
            When this size is reached, the Samba process providing the LDAP service
            will follow the NULL pointer, terminating the process. There is no further
            vulnerability associated with this issue, merely a denial of service.
    CVE-2018-19607:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-19607
        summary: Exiv2::isoSpeed in easyaccess.cpp in Exiv2 v0.27-RC2 allows remote
            attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application
            crash) via a crafted file.
    CVE-2018-14646:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-14646
        summary: The Linux kernel before 4.15-rc8 was found to be vulnerable to a
            NULL pointer dereference bug in the __netlink_ns_capable() function in
            the net/netlink/af_netlink.c file. A local attacker could exploit this
            when a net namespace with a netnsid is assigned to cause a kernel panic
            and a denial of service.
    CVE-2018-19542:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-19542
        summary: An issue was discovered in JasPer 2.0.14. There is a NULL pointer
            dereference in the function jp2_decode in libjasper/jp2/jp2_dec.c, leading
            to a denial of service.
    CVE-2018-19532:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-19532
        summary: A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the function PdfTranslator::setTarget()
            in pdftranslator.cpp of PoDoFo 0.9.6, while creating the PdfXObject, as
            demonstrated by podofoimpose. It allows an attacker to cause Denial of
            Service.
    CVE-2018-10773:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-10773
        summary: NULL pointer deference in the addsn function in serialno.c in libbibcore.a
            in bibutils through 6.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
            (application crash), as demonstrated by copac2xml.
    CVE-2018-10768:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-10768
        summary: There is a NULL pointer dereference in the AnnotPath::getCoordsLength
            function in Annot.h in an Ubuntu package for Poppler 0.24.5. A crafted
            input will lead to a remote denial of service attack. Later Ubuntu packages
            such as for Poppler 0.41.0 are not affected.
    CVE-2018-10548:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-10548
        summary: An issue was discovered in PHP before 5.6.36, 7.0.x before 7.0.30,
            7.1.x before 7.1.17, and 7.2.x before 7.2.5. ext/ldap/ldap.c allows remote
            LDAP servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
            application crash) because of mishandling of the ldap_get_dn return value.
    CVE-2018-10535:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-10535
        summary: The ignore_section_sym function in elf.c in the Binary File Descriptor
            (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.30, does
            not validate the output_section pointer in the case of a symtab entry
            with a "SECTION" type that has a "0" value, which allows remote attackers
            to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application
            crash) via a crafted file, as demonstrated by objcopy.
    CVE-2018-10373:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-10373

    CVE-2018-7285:
        cve_id: CVE-2018-7285
        summary: A NULL pointer access issue was discovered in Asterisk 15.x through
            15.2.1. The RTP support in Asterisk maintains its own registry of dynamic
            codecs and desired payload numbers. While an SDP negotiation may result
            in a codec using a different payload number, these desired ones are still
            stored internally. When an RTP packet was received, this registry would
            be consulted if the payload number was not found in the negotiated SDP.
            This registry was incorrectly consulted for all packets, even those which
            are dynamic. If the payload number resulted in a codec of a different
            type than the RTP stream (for example, the payload number resulted in
            a video codec but the stream carried audio), a crash could occur if no
            stream of that type had been negotiated. This was due to the code incorrectly
            assuming that a stream of that type would always exist.

    CVE-2017-14318:
        cve_id: CVE-2017-14318
        summary: An issue was discovered in Xen 4.5.x through 4.9.x. The function
            `__gnttab_cache_flush` handles GNTTABOP_cache_flush grant table operations.
            It checks to see if the calling domain is the owner of the page that is
            to be operated on. If it is not, the owner's grant table is checked to
            see if a grant mapping to the calling domain exists for the page in question.
            However, the function does not check to see if the owning domain actually
            has a grant table or not. Some special domains, such as `DOMID_XEN`, `DOMID_IO`
            and `DOMID_COW` are created without grant tables. Hence, if __gnttab_cache_flush
            operates on a page owned by these special domains, it will attempt to
            dereference a NULL pointer in the domain struct.
    CVE-2017-14228:

            access in the function paste_tokens() in preproc.c, aka a NULL pointer
            dereference. It will lead to remote denial of service.
    CVE-2017-14225:
        cve_id: CVE-2017-14225
        summary: The av_color_primaries_name function in libavutil/pixdesc.c in FFmpeg
            3.3.3 may return a NULL pointer depending on a value contained in a file,
            but callers do not anticipate this, as demonstrated by the avcodec_string
            function in libavcodec/utils.c, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.
            (It is also conceivable that there is security relevance for a NULL pointer
            dereference in av_color_primaries_name calls within the ffprobe command-line
            program.)
    CVE-2017-14181:

        summary: A vulnerability was found in Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload Contact
            Form 7 5.0.6.1. It has been classified as critical. Affected is an unknown
            function of the file admin-ajax.php. The manipulation of the argument
            upload_name leads to relative path traversal. It is possible to launch
            the attack remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and
            may be used. The identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-222072.
    CVE-2022-31163:
        cve_id: CVE-2022-31163
        summary: TZInfo is a Ruby library that provides access to time zone data and
            allows times to be converted using time zone rules. Versions prior to
            0.36.1, as well as those prior to 1.2.10 when used with the Ruby data
            source tzinfo-data, are vulnerable to relative path traversal. With the
            Ruby data source, time zones are defined in Ruby files. There is one file
            per time zone. Time zone files are loaded with `require` on demand. In
            the affected versions, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` fails to validate time zone
            identifiers correctly, allowing a new line character within the identifier.
            With Ruby version 1.9.3 and later, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` can be made
            to load unintended files with `require`, executing them within the Ruby
            process. Versions 0.3.61 and 1.2.10 include fixes to correctly validate
            time zone identifiers. Versions 2.0.0 and later are not vulnerable. Version
            0.3.61 can still load arbitrary files from the Ruby load path if their
            name follows the rules for a valid time zone identifier and the file has
            a prefix of `tzinfo/definition` within a directory in the load path. Applications
            should ensure that untrusted files are not placed in a directory on the
            load path. As a workaround, the time zone identifier can be validated
            before passing to `TZInfo::Timezone.get` by ensuring it matches the regular
            expression `\A[A-Za-z0-9+\-_]+(?:\/[A-Za-z0-9+\-_]+)*\z`.
    CVE-2021-32964:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-32964
        summary: The AGG Software Web Server version 4.0.40.1014 and prior is vulnerable
            to a path traversal attack, which may allow an attacker to read arbitrary
            files from the file system.
    CVE-2021-34605:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-34605
        summary: A zip slip vulnerability in XINJE XD/E Series PLC Program Tool up
            to version v3.5.1 can provide an attacker with arbitrary file write privilege
            when opening a specially-crafted project file. This vulnerability can
            be triggered by manually opening an infected project file, or by initiating
            an upload program request from an infected Xinje PLC. This can result
            in remote code execution, information disclosure and denial of service
            of the system running the XINJE XD/E Series PLC Program Tool.
    CVE-2021-41178:
        cve_id: CVE-2021-41178
        summary: Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. Prior
            to versions 20.0.13, 21.0.5, and 22.2.0, a file traversal vulnerability
            makes an attacker able to download arbitrary SVG images from the host
            system, including user provided files. This could also be leveraged into
            a XSS/phishing attack, an attacker could upload a malicious SVG file that
            mimics the Nextcloud login form and send a specially crafted link to victims.
            The XSS risk here is mitigated due to the fact that Nextcloud employs
            a strict Content-Security-Policy disallowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript.
            It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server be upgraded to 20.0.13, 21.0.5
            or 22.2.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.
    CVE-2021-41127:

        summary: Rasa is an open source machine learning framework to automate text-and
            voice-based conversations. In affected versions a vulnerability exists
            in the functionality that loads a trained model `tar.gz` file which allows
            a malicious actor to craft a `model.tar.gz` file which can overwrite or
            replace bot files in the bot directory. The vulnerability is fixed in
            Rasa 2.8.10. For users unable to update ensure that users do not upload
            untrusted model files, and restrict CLI or API endpoint access where a
            malicious actor could target a deployed Rasa instance.
    CVE-2021-29488:
