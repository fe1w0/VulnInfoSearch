loop is a single
    // element and can be combined with the next (y3) as an inner broadcast.
    //
    // Note that this handles the case of pure scalar broadcast when
    // y0 == y1 == y2 == 1. With low overhead it handles cases such as scalar
    // broadcast with batch (as y2 > 1).
    //
    // NOTE The process is the same as the above general case except
    // simplified for y4 == 1 and the loop over y3 is contained within the
    // AddScalarBroadcast function.
