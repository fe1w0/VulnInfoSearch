which returns the lower triangular sparse Cholesky
// factor of a CSRSparseMatrix, using the fill-in reducing permutation.
//
// The CSRSparseMatrix may represent a single sparse matrix (rank 2) or a batch
// of sparse matrices (rank 3). Each component must represent a symmetric
// positive definite (SPD) matrix. In particular, this means the component
// matrices must be square. We don't actually check if the input is symmetric,
// only the lower triangular part of each component is read.
//
// The associated permutation must be a Tensor of rank (R - 1), where the
// CSRSparseMatrix has rank R. Additionally, the batch dimension of the
// CSRSparseMatrix and the pe
