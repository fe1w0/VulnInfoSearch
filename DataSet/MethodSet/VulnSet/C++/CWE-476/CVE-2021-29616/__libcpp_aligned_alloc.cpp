  // We only apply this optimization if we don't increase the number of control
  // edges across device boundaries, e.g. in cases a) and b) if NoOp and
  // a and x, respectively, are on the same device. Control edges across device
  // boundaries require inter-device communication (Send/Recv pairs to be
  // inserted in the graph), which is very costly.
  //
  // We also remove identity nodes, subject to the same constraints on number of
  // resulting co
