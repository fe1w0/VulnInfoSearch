    // Linux supports 3 kinds of unix sockets; behavior of this struct
        // is in `man 7 unix`; relevant parts:
        // - unnamed: 0-length path. As paths are not required to be
        //   null-terminated, this needs to be undicated by the size.
        //   These might be created by `socketpair()`, for eaxmple.
        // - pathname (common): nothing strange. struct size technically
        //   indicates length, but null terminators are usually set. This
        //   does matter if addr.length() == size of the char array though
