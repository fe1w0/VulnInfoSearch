/**
 * Check that a field name is valid UTF8, does not start with a '$',
 * and contains no '.' characters. Set bson bit field appropriately.
 * Note that we don't need to check for '\0' because we're using
 * strlen(3), which stops at '\0'.
 *
 * @param b The bson object to which field name will be appended.
 * @param string The field name as char*.
 * @param length The length of the field name.
 *
 * @return BSON_OK if valid UTF8 and BSON_ERROR if not. All BSON strings must be
 *     valid UTF8. This function will also check whether the string
 *     contains '.' or starts with '$', since the validity of this depends on context.
 *     Set the value of b->err appropriately.
