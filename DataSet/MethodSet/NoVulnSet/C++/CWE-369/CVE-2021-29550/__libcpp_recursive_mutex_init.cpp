tion of a series of 2D planes.
    //
    // For each element of a 'slice' (2D plane) of output_backprop, we need to
    // figure out its contributors when doing FractionalAvgPool operation. This
    // can be done based on row_pooling_sequence, col_pooling_seq and
    // overlapping.
    // Once we figure out the original contributors, we just need to evenly
    // divide the value of this element among these contributors.
    //
    // Internally, we divide the out_backprop tensor and store it in a temporary
    // tensor of double type. A
