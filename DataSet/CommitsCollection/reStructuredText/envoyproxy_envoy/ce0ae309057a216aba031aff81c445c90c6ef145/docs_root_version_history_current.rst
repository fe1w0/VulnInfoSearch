1.22.0 (pending)
================

Incompatible Behavior Changes
-----------------------------
*Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

* tls: set TLS v1.2 as the default minimal version for servers. Users can still explicitly opt-in to 1.0 and 1.1 using :ref:`tls_minimum_protocol_version <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.TlsParameters.tls_minimum_protocol_version>`.

Minor Behavior Changes
----------------------
*Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*

* dynamic_forward_proxy: if a DNS resolution fails, failing immediately with a specific resolution error, rather than finishing up all local filters and failing to select an upstream host.
* ext_authz: added requested server name in ext_authz network filter for auth review.
* file: changed disk based files to truncate files which are not being appended to. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.append_or_truncate`` to false.
* grpc: flip runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_grpc_async_client_cache`` to be default enabled. async grpc client created through getOrCreateRawAsyncClient will be cached by default.
* http: avoiding delay-close for HTTP/1.0 responses framed by connection: close as well as HTTP/1.1 if the request is fully read. This means for responses to such requests, the FIN will be sent immediately after the response. This behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.skip_delay_close`` to false.  If clients are are seen to be receiving sporadic partial responses and flipping this flag fixes it, please notify the project immediately.
* http: now the max concurrent streams of http2 connection can not only be adjusted down according to the SETTINGS frame but also can be adjusted up, of course, it can not exceed the configured upper bounds. This fix is guarded by ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_allow_capacity_increase_by_settings``.
* http: when writing custom filters, `injectEncodedDataToFilterChain` and `injectDecodedDataToFilterChain` now trigger sending of headers if they were not yet sent due to `StopIteration`. Previously, calling one of the inject functions in that state would trigger an assertion. See issue #19891 for more details.
* perf: ssl contexts are now tracked without scan based garbage collection and greatly improved the performance on secret update.

Bug Fixes
---------
*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*

* access_log: fix memory leak when reopening an access log fails. Access logs will now try to be reopened on each subsequent flush attempt after a failure.
* data plane: fixing error handling where writing to a socket failed while under the stack of processing. This should genreally affect HTTP/3. This behavioral change can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_upstream_inline_write`` to false.
* eds: fix the eds cluster update by allowing update on the locality of the cluster endpoints. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.support_locality_update_on_eds_cluster_endpoints`` to false.
* tcp_proxy: fix a crash that occurs when configured for :ref:`upstream tunneling <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.tunneling_config>` and the downstream connection disconnects while the the upstream connection or http/2 stream is still being established.
* tls: fix a bug while matching a certificate SAN with an exact value in ``match_typed_subject_alt_names`` of a listener where wildcard ``*`` character is not the only character of the dns label. Example, ``baz*.example.net`` and ``*baz.example.net`` and ``b*z.example.net`` will match ``baz1.example.net`` and ``foobaz.example.net`` and ``buzz.example.net``, respectively.
* upstream: fix stack overflow when a cluster with large number of idle connections is removed.
* xray: fix the AWS X-Ray tracer extension to not sample the trace if ``sampled=`` keyword is not present in the header ``x-amzn-trace-id``.

New Features
------------
* access_log: make consistent access_log format fields ``%(DOWN|DIRECT_DOWN|UP)STREAM_(LOCAL|REMOTE)_*%`` to provide all combinations of local & remote addresses for upstream & downstream connections.
* admin: :http:post:`/logging` now accepts ``/logging?paths=name1:level1,name2:level2,...`` to change multiple log levels at once.
* config: added new file based xDS configuration via :ref:`path_config_source <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.ConfigSource.path_config_source>`.
  :ref:`watched_directory <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.PathConfigSource.watched_directory>` can
  be used to setup an independent watch for when to reload the file path, for example when using
  Kubernetes ConfigMaps to deliver configuration. See the linked documentation for more information.
* cors: add dynamic support for headers ``access-control-allow-methods`` and ``access-control-allow-headers`` in cors.
* http: added random_value_specifier in :ref:`weighted_clusters <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.weighted_clusters>` to allow random value to be specified from configuration proto.
* http: added support for :ref:`proxy_status_config <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.proxy_status_config>` for configuring `Proxy-Status <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-proxy-status-08>`_ HTTP response header fields.
* http: make consistent custom header format fields ``%(DOWN|DIRECT_DOWN|UP)STREAM_(LOCAL|REMOTE)_*%`` to provide all combinations of local & remote addresses for upstream & downstream connections.
* http3: downstream HTTP/3 support is now GA! Upstream HTTP/3 also GA for specific deployments. See :ref:`here <arch_overview_http3>` for details.
* http3: supports upstream HTTP/3 retries. Automatically retry `0-RTT safe requests <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-4.2.1>`_ if they are rejected because they are sent `too early <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8470#section-5.2>`_. And automatically retry 0-RTT safe requests if connect attempt fails later on and the cluster is configured with TCP fallback. And add retry on ``http3-post-connect-failure`` policy which allows retry of failed HTTP/3 requests with TCP fallback even after handshake if the cluster is configured with TCP fallback. This feature is guarded by ``envoy.reloadable_features.conn_pool_new_stream_with_early_data_and_http3``.
* matching: the matching API can now express a match tree that will always match by omitting a matcher at the top level.
* outlier_detection: :ref:`max_ejection_time_jitter<envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.OutlierDetection.base_ejection_time>` configuration added to allow adding a random value to the ejection time to prevent 'thundering herd' scenarios. Defaults to 0 so as to not break or change the behavior of existing deployments.

Deprecated
----------

* config: deprecated :ref:`path <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.ConfigSource.path>` in favor of
  :ref:`path_config_source <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.ConfigSource.path_config_source>`
* http: removing support for long-deprecated old style filter names, e.g. envoy.router, envoy.lua.
* re2: removed undocumented histograms ``re2.program_size`` and ``re2.exceeded_warn_level``.
